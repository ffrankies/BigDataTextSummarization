GCS has about 1,000 substitutes in its system. May 16 will become an optional teacher workday for school personnel. Central offices will remain open and will operate on a regular schedule. Advanced Placement testing for schools will move to the May 23 make-up day. International Baccalaureate (IB) testing, which occurs off site, will move forward as planned since no make-up days are allowed. Test coordinators will work with individual families to ensure all students have transportation to the IB test sites. Middle school athletics are canceled on May 16. High school athletics will move forward as planned. May 16 will mark the ninth day out of school for GCS students, who have missed eight days due to inclement weather, including the recent tornado. Students at the three schools devastated by the tornado have missed three additional days of school. The district has made up two of these days. Since the district will meet the state minimum requirement of 1,025 instructional hours without making-up the lost instructional time, GCS does not plan to add more make-up days to the end of the school year, barring any more unexpected events, the release said.

One man is in critical condition with a gunshot wound in one of his arms, said David Marshall, chief nursing officer for University of Texas Medical Branch hospital. Authorities found explosive devices in the high school and in adjacent areas, said Walter Braun, Santa Fe Independent School District police chief. The school has been cleared of all students and staff, who have been directed to a nearby facility to reunite with their families, Braun said. This is no longer an active shooting situation and the injured are being treated. Law enforcement is in the process of rendering them safe. School has been evacuated. Call 911 if you see any suspicious item. The witness told KTRK she saw a girl shot in the leg. At least 12 people from the school are being treated at three hospitals, authorities said. Seven people are at Clear Lake Regional Medical in Webster, Texas; two patients are being treated at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City and three patients are at John Sealy University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Aerial video from the scene showed several police officers outside the school. Some were searching students and their backpacks. The witness who spoke to KTRK also said she heard an alarm.

Broward Schools are accepting applications for armed guardians to provide protection of school campuses. He said the district also employs 18 sworn officers who may be used at some schools as well. Off-duty police may also be hired. The state created the Aaron Feis Guardian program this year as part of a series of school safety measures enacted in the wake of the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland. The state now requires every school to have at least one school police officer or armed guardian in every school. The School Board would prefer to use only current police officers, but that would require more money from local cities, officials say. While every middle and high school has a sworn police officer, they are less common in elementary schools. Some cities, such as Sunrise and Parkland, provide an officer in every elementary. Fort Lauderdale and Oakland Park do not provide them in any elementary schools. Many cities provide a police officer who is shared by two or three elementary schools. The district said several cities have verbally agreed to provide more officers, but a spokeswoman declined to say which ones. The officers may not have much to do but stand at the school entrance with a gun. Last month, School Board members took out part of the proposed job description that allows school administration to assign additional duties to guardians besides just protecting the campus.

Parents like Lisa Duell say the district needs to make sure that all options are on the table. Duell is a leader with the school safety advocacy group Saving Our Students. Prior to the shooting, she says her group had been begging the district to improve safety at its schools. Duell says one of her biggest concerns is that the district employs the use of portable trailers as classrooms outside some of its schools. She went on to say the trailers are too exposed and don't offer the protection for the students inside that a brick and mortar building does. Duell says the amount of support she and her group have received from those in, and outside of the community has been overwhelming. One of those supporters is Max Schachter, the father of Alex Schachter who was killed during the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglass High School in Parkland, Florida. Schachter says he and his campaign plan on helping Noblesville parents and school safety advocates put pressure on local and state leaders to help secure schools.

There were about 200 people gathered there after the shooting, said Michael Doerrer, a spokesman for Frederick County Public Schools. The shooters, described as four black males dressed in black, remained at large as of late Wednesday night, according to Officer First Class M. Cox, who was present at the scene. A SWAT team was searching the school and the surrounding area. Lynesha McIntyre, a Gov. Thomas Johnson High School senior, said she was at Frederick High School at the time of the shooting, watching a junior varsity boys basketball game between Frederick and Gov. Thomas Johnson high schools. McIntyre said she saw four males dressed all in black walk into the gym a few minutes into the third quarter of the game. A few minutes later, they walked out. McIntyre said she then heard two shots. Dwayne Bishop and Kelly Onley also waited in their cars outside the school waiting for their 15-year-old son, Nicolas Bishop. Nicolas, who goes to Gov. Thomas Johnson High School and went to the game as a spectator, told his parents police were searching lockers at the school. An email alert from the school system shortly after 10:30 p.m. Wednesday said students who were kept at the school during the lockdown were released to their parents. The students were escorted in small groups in the parking lot of the Terrace Lanes bowling alley on West College Terrace. Doerrer said there was a security presence at the game, but he did not know how many people it involved.

But when your school is also the site of one of the deadliest school shootings in American history, nothing is ever really normal. There are other changes, too. There are now two principals at MSD, because the basic demands of running a school are now joined by the demands of managing a community in crisis. There are some new gates at certain entry points, a smattering of new portable classrooms; nothing too out of the ordinary. Until then, it stands there like a mausoleum, empty and silent. If Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were like any other school, the collective nerves of returning students and staff would be predictable responses to a new year, not the complex expectations and questions of survivors returning to a crime scene. Security concerns, and controversies, loom Kai Koerber is one of the roughly 3,100 MSD students returning to school today. He has high hopes that, while nothing can really be normal again, he and his fellow students will find some optimism. Koerber is dismayed that the school decided not to install metal detectors, one of several proposed security measures considered over the summer. Ultimately, the school shelved the idea until it could train staff on how to properly use them. It also discontinued the requirement of clear backpacks; a measure from last school year that prompted privacy concerns and dark-humored ridicule. However, students will notice other changes. There are 52 new security cameras on campus, a new intercom system, and new door lock systems and four additional security personnel. But the day 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz barged into his former school with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, they were pulled through a prism of identities: They became survivors, advocates, activists, leaders, mourners, celebrities, political figures and pariahs. Seventeen became victims, whose memories serve as the bedrock of so many movements of love and change. Looming over all of this, the school and the community of Parkland have become icons of the complex problem of gun violence in America. Some students are hoping a new school year will bring some much-needed balance. For many others returning to MSD, a public life of activism and leadership is now business as usual. Over the summer, Koerber attended a leadership summit in New Zealand, spoke at a Business Insider panel in Cannes and interned in Washington, DC with his congressman, Ted Deutch. Kyle Kashuv, another MSD survivor and rising senior, met with President Donald Trump over the summer and has become a regular commentator on conservative media outlets. For students like Koerber and Kashuv, who are trying to balance their lives as both students and newly minted agents of change, the constant attention is a price they are willing to pay for the cause. Political fabric is rewoven If Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were like any other school, the upcoming Broward County school board elections would be another unremarkable piece of local politics. Instead, they will be a referendum, a moment of truth for a community still reeling with grief and anger. Mourning parents have taken up the political mantle here, hungry for accountability from officials they say failed the students of MSD. Stand with Parkland, a group formed by families of the victims, condemned the Broward County School Board earlier this month, saying the board was indecisive in implementing security measures and in following up on independent investigations. On August 28, five of the nine embattled members of the Broward County School Board are up for re-election. Among those looking to take their seats are Lori Alhadeff and Ryan Petty. It changed everything around them. The ripples it set off have become waves, far across the country and as close as the nearest Parkland voting booth. As the school years go by, everyday details of hallways and fences and coaches and classes will fade back into a comforting monotony. And as long as what happened there continues to matter, it never will be. Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

By Daily Wire February 15, 2018 The Florida school shooting on Wednesday was a horrific massacre in which at least 17 people were murdered. In any ideal world, the number of students injured or murdered in school shootings should be zero, but because of the terrible number of students killed in the Wednesday massacre, it would be easy to assume, from the postures of some who have reacted to the tragedy, that great numbers of students and children have been killed in incessant school shootings. As information compiled by Michael Medved producer Greg Tomlin shows, in the years 2016 and 2017, at K-12 schools in America, of the 51 million students enrolled, there were seven children killed. That is seven human lives snuffed out, and the agony of the families who suffered the loss is incalculable, but seven is far less than one would suppose from the media coverage, which has misleadingly claimed that there were 18 school shootings in January alone.

Multiple shots were fired in the process, and one student was struck in the chest and was driven to a nearby hospital suffering non-life-threatening wounds. The student was taken into custody without further incident. The secretary heard the gunfire near the school and ordered the school to go on lockdown.

The Broward School District's security cameras did not provide real-time video for police during the Stoneman Douglas school shooting. An outdated radio system provided further confusion as officers tried to find Nikolas Cruz. Lisa J. Huriash, Stephen Hobbs and Megan O'MatzContact ReportersSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Nearly a half-hour after Nikolas Cruz dropped his rifle and fled Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, police thought they were seeing him live on security cameras, still in the building. They were actually seeing images tape-delayed. Pustizzi said the video delay made a chaotic situation more confusing, but he does not believe it slowed efforts to rescue injured students. Seventeen people were killed and many others wounded in a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a horrific episode of school violence that ended with the arrest of a former student. The suspect was identified as Nikolas Cruz, 19, who had been expelled from the school.... Authorities eventually captured him more than an hour after he left the school. Cruz, a troubled former student of Stoneman Douglas, confessed and could face the death penalty. Police radio transmissions reviewed by the Sun Sentinel reveal more details about the confusion at the scene as officers tried to determine what was happening and how best to respond to the worst school shooting since the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in 2012. -- Police communication was hampered by outmoded radios that left some transmissions inaudible. Peterson was on the 45-acre campus during the attack but not in the targeted building, Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie previously told the Sun Sentinel. Runcie said Thursday that Stoneman Douglas, like other Broward public schools, has cameras that show images in real time but can also be viewed on a tape delay. He said he did not know that police were confused about whether the tape was live or not. Broward Sheriff Scott Israel said at a press conference Wednesday that he did not know anything about video delays but said he would look into it. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Wednesday claimed 17 lives. JAIME GUTTENBERG Jaime Guttenberg was a student at the school. Her father, Fred,... Once inside the freshman building, police struggled to determine where the shooter was. They watched Cruz on camera, seeing him drop his bag near the stairway as sirens blared in the background. An armored vehicle sat at the ready. But by then Cruz was gone. By 3:02 p.m., the radio transmissions show, officers had realized there was a delay. Their day will be spent meeting with state lawmakers and taking part in large mid-day rally. About an hour and a half behind schedule, three... The cameras are not controlled by the Broward Sheriff Office but by the School Board, Pustizzi said. Pete Blair, a criminal justice professor and executive director of the active shooter response program at Texas State University, said such a long camera delay is unusual. Radio breakdowns also hampered police response to the mass shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport a year ago. Some police could hear but not talk as they were trying to determine if there was a second shooter. During the Stoneman Douglas shooting, a dispatcher warned all units at 2:56 p.m. that the radios were malfunctioning. They were actually seeing images tape-delayed."}

According to data from Everytown for Gun Safety, which tracks gun violence and other shootings on school grounds, there have been at least 94 gun-related deaths and more than 156 people injured as a result of more than 200 school shooting incidents since Sandy Hook. Here we go. Starting off with a lie is bad, but gives us a pretty good indication that Everytown is far less interested in the truth than they are pushing a narrative. The gunman brought a gun into a school classroom and opened fire on other students. This is our first conventional school shooting. Not a school shooting. LOUIS, MO Stevens Institute of Business & Arts This was a shooting of a college administrator in a dispute over financial aid. This was a legitimate school shooting, our second. Not school shooting. Again atypical, but an on-campus attack of a student. This was not a school shooting. This shooting had nothing at all to due with the school, the students, the faculty, or the staff. This was not a school shooting. This was not an attack, and is therefore not a school shooting. While tragic, this was not an attack nor meant to be and therefore not a school shooting. This is our fourth conventional school shooting. Atypical, but still an attack against a student on campus. This atypical shooting counts. Atypical, but still a shooting of a student by a student on campus. Horrific, but not a school shooting. Authorities cautioned that the incidents were not directly related to the community college. They said the school just happened to be where the shootings ended. School was not in session, and no students were on campus. It find it hard to classify this as a school shooting since there was not school being held. This was a cry for help from a young man who never attempted to hurt any faculty, staff, or students, and even stated precisely that. School clerk Antoinette Tuff talked him him into surrendering. Disturbing, but not a school shooting. A legitimate-by-any-definition school shooting. Personal dispute, but was on campus during the school day and the victims were both students.This is our sixth conventional school shooting of 29 claimed. Not an attack on any faculty, staff, or students. Not a school shooting. Our seventh conventional shoot shooting in 31 cases so far. Not school shooting. It was on-campus and the wounded man was a student. Atypical but it counts. He was on campus. While non-conventional, it counts. A tragedy, but not a school shooting. This counts. This is our eighth conventional school shooting of 36 claimed. There was regrettably one casualty. This is one of several instances where SROs have kept a Sandy Hook-type mass shooting from occurring on campus, and another incident that validates the National School Shield concept and the work done by the Homeland Security Institute at Purdue University, which shows that when school campuses are protected by a combination of armed SROs and concealed carrying faculty and staff, casualties are greatly reduced. Nice try, Everytown. It counts as out 10th conventional school shooting, of 39 claimed. 11th conventional school shooting so far of 40. One of two black males on the edge of school property discharged a handgun, but not at the faculty, staff, or students. Everytown is trying to pull a fast one, again. Count it. 12th conventional school shooting so far. Not a school shooting. Count it. 13th conventional shooting. Not conventional, but an on-campus murder of a student. That was the freaking headline, Everytown. No students involved. Lazy, Everytown. Even for you. Nobody had been hit. Shooter did not try to harm anyone else. Attacker was a non-student. Shooting was in apparent retaliation of ran incident that took place the weekend before, also off-campus. No sale. Was on campus killing of a student by another student after hours. Lazy, Everytown. There are no definitive links however, tying the incidents together, and it does not appear there were ever any arrests. Everytown should be ashamed. The linked story is the only media mention of the incident at all. Not a conventional shoot shooting, but we are counting those outside of dorms. Horrible story. Not a school shooting. Not an attack, and not a school shooting. Not remotely what one would consider a school shooting. Again, not close to being a school shooting by even the most charitable definition. Not remotely a school shooting. A student was injured by debris from what are believed to be bullets fired through a dorm wall. Unconventional but it counts. Not a school shooting. Nope. Horrific she was caught in the crossfire. Not a school shooting. More killing was thwarted by a student who is a shooting enthusiast and NRA supporter, who also kept the killer from committing suicide. Decidedly not a school shooting. Not a school shooting. Not a school shooting. Stupid, but not a school shooting. Ever. It counts as an atypical school shooting. Never an attempt to hurt anyone else. Not a school shooting. Not anything remotely like an attack, or a school shooting. Not a school shooting. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 19th of 81 claimed. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 20th of 82 claimed. Gang involvement suspected. Not a school shooting. Everytown is lucky we have the dorm rule in place. Not an attack, not a school shooting. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 21st of 88 claimed, and the only mass school shooting on the list. Ironically, one of the wounded has a concealed carry permit, but was disarmed by campus policy. He might have ended the rampage before it got going.This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 22nd of 89 claimed. Nope. Not a legitimate school shooting. Former cop tried to murder his ex through a school building window. She was a student on campus, so it counts even though it could have happened anywhere. 23rd conventional. Tragic, but not a school shooting. Not a school shooting. The location of the shooter was not known. While a bullet hit the school, it was not aimed at anyone and the police do not think he was attempting to hurt anyone else. Not a school shooting. Very sad. Not a school shooting. Not a school shooting. It could have happened anywhere, but it counts as our 25th of 100 claimed. Not remotely a legitimate school shooting. Not a legitimate school shooting. Not enough information to call this an intentional attack. Not a school shooting. Lazy basic fact-finding by Everytown, yet again. Not remotely a school shooting. Not a school shooting. There were not students, faculty, or staff targeted. Not any sort of attack, and not a school shooting. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 26th of 109 claimed. No attempt made to hard faculty, staff, or students. This is a legitimate school shooting, if not a classroom shooting. 27th. Close, but no cigar. Not a school shooting. Not a school shooting. Not an attack. Not a school shooting. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 28th of 115 claimed. Not remotely a school shooting. Stupid, but not a school shooting. No one was targeted. No one was injured. Not an attack, so not a school shooting. Very sad. Not an attack. Not A school shooting. Not an attack. Not a school shooting. Not close to being a school shooting. One idiot shot at the other. Come on, Everytown. This is just embarrassing for you. Cat not enrolled as a student. Not a school shooting. This is simply pathetic. Why Mike Bloomberg has these people still employed after so shamefully embarrassing him is beyond me. No faculty, staff, or students were targeted or involved. Not a school shooting. While atypical, he was shooting at students and so this counts. Shots were fired on campus, but not at faculty, staff, students, or the bagpiper. Not a school shooting, as there was no attack. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 29th of 132 claimed. Not a school shooting. Never send your children to this hellhole. Draft them into a war instead. It might be safer. 30th conventional shooting of 134 claimed. Not a school shooting. Count it as a conventional, the 31st. No faculty, staff, or students were targeted. Not a school shooting. Not a targeted shooting, no students, faculty, or staff, were injured. No crime was committed. Not a school shooting. ROSEBERG, OR Umpqua Community College A legitimate mass shooting on a college campus. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 33rd of 141 claimed. Was not an targeted attack against any faculty, staff, or students. Not a school shooting. He then shot the four people who pursued him. This is not a school shooting in any reasonable interpretation of the term. How embarrassing. No injuries in this atypical school shooting. There does not appear to be any evidence that the suspect tried to harm anyone. This is not a school shooting. There was no attempt to target faculty, staff, or students, just the car in the parking lot. This is not a school shooting. This was horrible crime, but not a school shooting by any reasonable definition. Not remotely a school shooting. This meets our criteria for an atypical school shooting. He claimed after the fact that he meant to do it. Fortunately, the student survived. No attempts were made to harm anyone. Not a school shooting. Not intentional, not a school shooting. Details are very sketchy, but is does not appear there was any sort of a conflict, or that he shot at anyone. Not a school shooting. Everytown begins logging 2016 data here. No shots were fired at any humans. Not a school shooting. This counts. Not an attack. Not a school shooting. As this was a school function it counts. A clear school shooting, the 34th of 163 claimed.

Everytown is trying to classify the black nationalist murders of Dallas Police officers as a school shooting because the gunman fired from the parking deck of the school. What disgusting human beings they are. One shot the other, then committed suicide. That this occurred on campus instead of down the street or somewhere else is completely irrelevant. Not a school shooting by any reasonable determination. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 40th of 188 claimed. Student intended to murder her stepbrother at school. Shot a girl who discovered her with the gun in the school bathroom, then committed suicide. This is a legitimate, conventional school shooting, the 41st of 189 claimed.

Officer Mark Dallas shot and injured the 19-year-old gunman at Dixon High School and took him into custody Wednesday morning. At a news conference a few hours later, officials said they were pleased to discover that students had barricaded themselves into classrooms by blocking doorways with chairs, desks and other furniture. Police have not said why the former student came to the school armed with a gun on a day when students were rehearsing for their upcoming graduation ceremony. Lockdown has been lifted at the other schools in the city about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Chicago.

Many families thought their kids would be safe in their school building. The shock of that day pummeled Oklahoma parents like debris from the EF-5. Seven 3rd graders died in their school. It was a first for us; a heart-stopping wake-up call. In the wake of that storm, the conversation started to change. Oklahoma schools looked to Joplin, Missouri. In 2013, Joplin Public Schools were re-building with safe rooms after a deadly EF-5 in 2011. We looked to the parents of those poor children who died at Plaza Towers Elementary School. The truth is, everyone wants safe rooms in schools. Everyone wants a safe place for children in a storm. The catch has always been how to pay for it - for expensive FEMA-rated safe room upgrades. In Oklahoma, we have found a way. In Moore, there were just two safe rooms in the district in 2013. In the past five years, they've built two dozen more. The district has completed construction on all but nine safe room projects. In Edmond and Deer Creek Public Schools, administrators are committed to building safe rooms in every new school building. Additionally, since 2013, both districts have added safe rooms in older school buildings so all students have the same protection at school. In the state's largest school district with 74 schools, Oklahoma City Public Schools, there were only five safe rooms in 2013. Those shelters were built with FEMA mitigation grants following the May 3, 1999, tornado. OKCPS built those five safe rooms in 2004 and then stopped building safe rooms in the district. On the day of the May 20 tornado, Oklahoma City Public Schools hadn't built a safe room in a decade. In fact, the district had started construction on new gymnasiums, without a safe room component in an effort to save money. Public outcry caused the school board to reverse course. Nichols Hills Elementary got the first safe room in the district. Since then, 27 more elementary schools' gyms have been built as large safe rooms. Three more will be complete by the end of the year. Putnam City had zero safe rooms in 2013. Since the Moore tornado, the district has added three safe rooms at elementary schools and a middle school safe room that's nearly complete. The district is adding a safe room locker room to the gym at PC High School. With 27 schools in the district, they've got a long way to go. So, Putnam City Public Schools took a close look at what else they could do to protect students. Engineers identified the safest place in every building. In two elementary schools, the district has added FEMA-rated doors and windows to harden the structure. Since the Moore tornado, almost every school district in the metro has added at least one safe room. Several small school districts like Crooked Oak Schools, Luther Public Schools and Deer Creek Public Schools now have safe rooms in every building. Big districts have made progress, too. There are 28 new safe rooms in Oklahoma City Public Schools, 24 in Moore Public Schools, 13 in Edmond Public Schools, five in Mid-Del Public Schools, four in Norman Public Schools, three in Putnam City Public Schools and two in Mustang Public Schools. El Reno Public Schools had zero safe rooms in 2013. Today, the district has a FEMA-rated shelter for every student. El Reno actually failed to pass a bond issue for schools in 2012. In 2013, the May 31 tornado came dangerously close to their district. So, school officials worked with city officials to craft a new bond issue with a dual purpose: shelters for students and for the community so everyone in El Reno has a safe place to go. The El Reno safe rooms are unlike almost all of the other safe rooms around town. They are built mostly underground, unfurnished and open to the entire community. El Reno built their shelters in multiple locations with easy access for students at school. Roblyer said the entire district population can get from the classroom to the safe room in six minutes. Once again, Oklahomans have proven we learned from the horror of that day. Those 3rd graders did not die in vain. Oklahoma school districts are building safer schools because they know what can happen if they don't. MPS expects to have every school site protected by March 2019. The district expects to have every school site protected by 2020. Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email."}

On Jan. 25, a man was shot and killed across the street from Montlieu Avenue Elementary in High Point. On March 6, a man was shot in the leg in the crosswalk across from Jones Elementary School in Greensboro. In both situations, the schools went into a lockdown out of precaution. Once police and school officials determined the shootings were isolated incidents, the lockdowns were lifted. But people who live in Hampton Homes near Jones Elementary were surprised the shooting happened -- especially at 2 p.m. just before school let out. Capt. Sean Gladieux, with the Greensboro Police Department, says Hampton Homes is a relatively safe neighborhood, but they may increase patrols after the shooting to reassure residents of the department's presence. Gladieux said officers work with the local crossing guards to get to know children who walk to and from school. There are no school resource officers at elementary schools, so officers take more time to patrol the neighborhood and volunteer at the school.

Persons evacuated from Arapahoe High School in Centenial, Colorado, walk on the school's track after a shooting at the school. Story highlights Handling of shooting at Arapahoe High School drew important lessons from Columbine Authorities say officers responded within minutes and immediately entered the school Teachers immediately locked down and moved students to the rear of classrooms It has become a tragically familiar scene in American life: law enforcement officers descending on a packed school where a gunman is on the loose. A procession of students, their hands raised, slowly making their way out of the danger zone. But the handling of Friday's shooting at Arapahoe High School -- just 10 miles from the scene of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before fatally shooting themselves -- drew important lessons from the earlier bloodshed. At Arapahoe High School, where senior Claire Davis, 17, was critically injured before the shooter turned the gun on himself, law enforcement officers responded within minutes and immediately entered the school to confront the gunman rather than surrounding the building, authorities said. As the sound of shots reverberated through the corridors, teachers immediately followed procedures put in place after Columbine, locking the doors and moving students to the rear of classrooms. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson credited the quick police response time for the fact that student Karl Pierson, the gunman, stopped firing on others and turned his weapon on himself. In fact, Robinson told reporters Saturday, Pierson killed himself less than 1 minute, 20 seconds after entering the school. Robinson said a deputy sheriff assigned as a school resource officer and an unarmed security guard immediately closed in on the shooter. Authorities knew from research and contact with forensic psychologists that school shooters typically continue firing until confronted by law enforcement, Robinson said. Robinson said the so-called active shooter response protocol, which was developed after Columbine, was put into place. In addition, school staff and students implemented a well-rehearsed lockdown practice. In Sandy Hook, a school custodian's 911 calls provided authorities some of the first information about what was happening. At Arapahoe High School, a school janitor spotted Pierson, whose intended target was a faculty member, in his tactical gear, he told CNN affiliate KMGH. That's when I knew. Llerenas said he called 911 and then escorted the targeted faculty member out of the school. Pierson had fired at the man but missed, Llerenas told KUSA. Trump said other lessons learned from Columbine included the controlled evacuations and pat-down searches of students in a secure area. Self evacuations can create chaos for the police. After Sandy Hook. Some even suggested that elementary school students use items such as cans of soup to attack gunmen. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. .d8888b."}

One of the injured boys, Jacob Hall, was airlifted to Greenville Memorial Hospital where he underwent surgery Wednesday afternoon. Jacob died Saturday at 12:56 p.m., Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said. The second boy and the teacher, Meghan Hollingsworth, were taken by ambulance to AnMed. They were treated and released Wednesday, Ross Norton with AnMed said.

The note says she's not interested in giving any interviews. A truck, believed to have been driven by the teen, crashed into a fence surrounding the playground and was left there. Anderson County Deputy Chief Keith Smith said the shooting happened on the playground and the shooter never got inside the school. Jamie Brock, 30-year veteran volunteer firefighter who responded to the school after the shooting, took down the suspect on the playground, Smith said. Sheriff John Skipper said Brock likely prevented more shots from being fired by confronting the shooter and taking him down.

Armed officers were at the school about seven minutes after the call and the suspect was in custody in less than an hour, officials said. Shooting suspect's father found dead The Anderson County Coroner's Office is also investigating the death of the shooter's father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Dewitt Osborne at his home on Osborne Road in Townville. The location is a little more than 3 miles from school. Jeffrey Osborne was shot to death, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said. The teen is the suspect in his father's death, Skipper said. Shore said the teen called his grandparents on his cellphone at 1:44 p.m. The grandmother said he was crying and so upset she couldn't understand him, so she and her husband went to Osborne's home to see if their grandson was there. The grandson was not there, but they found their son's body. At 1:45 p.m., a teacher called to report the shooting at the school. Osborne's wife released a statement Thursday morning through her pastor. Impact on the Townville community Dr. Joanne Avery, Anderson County District 4 superintendent, said there are video cameras in the school, and though the school does not have a resource officer, the staff has had lots of active shooter training and that helped during and after the shooting. Avery said school at Townville Elementary is canceled for rest of week and counseling services will be available.

The principal, through the fears of her own, she did what was right to ensure the safety of her school. They deserve to be called heroes and I tip my hat to them. For the victims and for little Jacob, who is fighting to survive, the young children that were affected and continue to be affected by this, the parents who will be called upon to put all the pieces back together, for my comrades, my brothers who witnessed what we should never have to witness and assisted alongside without hesitation, for all these, I ask your prayers. This will not take us down and brighter days are ahead as we begin to heal. Within the first few minutes, I made contact by phone to the front office confirming that there was an actual shooter. With the information that we gathered from the front office, we were told that the shooter and the injured were in the rear of the school around the playground. At that time, Firefighter Brock and I immediately left my nearby farm and raced to the school to try and help. When we drove in to that rear parking lot, we immediately noticed a black pickup truck that had crashed into the playground area. Firefighter Brock and I quickly got out and we made a face-to-face assessment. We went to the black truck. We searched for anything, anybody. There was no gunman inside the truck. Nothing else that we saw that posed a threat at that point in time at that location. Jamie and I talked and we decided that we would split up. So, we split and he went down the sidewalk as I entered the building. We quickly checked the other two. The teacher, Mrs. Hollingsworth, at that time, was seated and was telling us to take care of Jacob and not worry about her. At that point, the nurse and I continued to work with Jacob as long as we could until we were assisted by other agencies. Oconee personnel came in to assist. We went with further advanced life support care for the child. And at that time, we were able to get more law enforcement on scene to clear the building. . At that time, Jacob was taken out and was flown for immediate treatment with critical injuries to Greenville Memorial. Mrs. Hollingsworth and one other student were transported by ground to ANMED hospital. While these events were taking place within the school, unbeknownst to me, Firefighter Brock had continued his search on the outside of the building. As Firefighter Brock made his way to the rear corner, he observed the shooter a short distance away. Feeling it was imperative to the safety of the students, the teachers and all the responders that were on site, he immediately confronted and subdued that shooter. He was able to keep him on the ground until law enforcement could place him into custody. Over the next hour, school staff, firefighters, paramedics and law enforcement worked seamlessly together to ensure the safety and security of those remaining in the school. They ensured that each child and teacher were safe and accounted for and moved to a safe location to be reunited with their families. Over the past 24 hours, the word hero has been used to describe the actions of Firefighter Brock and the other responders.. Well, we agree with that. But we also believe that the teachers and staff of the Townville Elementary School, who protected their children in the moments following those gunshots are heroes just as well. We also believe that the entire community of Townville are also heroes for their support that they have shown to everyone involved during this toughest time that you can imagine. We ask that you continue to pray for law enforcement, our paramedics, firefighters, dispatchers, teachers and students, who were involved in the event of yesterday. But please, especially continue to pray and remember little Jacob. Copyright 2016 FOX Carolina (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

Dan Scheneman reports. The boy did not show any emotion as he walked into the courtroom wearing a yellow jumpsuit. He was unrestrained, not wearing handcuffs or leg shackles, as required by state law in most juvenile cases. His family said they were praying for a miracle. The judge agreed to that, and ordered the teen to be held in jail. The Associated Press typically does not identify juveniles charged with crimes. Authorities say the teen shot his 47-year-old father Jeffrey Osborne at their home on Wednesday afternoon before driving a pickup truck 3 miles down a country road to Townville Elementary. Bullets struck two students and a first-grade teacher. The building was immediately placed on lock down.

They have said the boy was being homeschooled, but have not explained why. When juveniles accused of violent crimes are 14 or 15, a prosecutor has 30 days to ask a family court judge to try the teen as an adult. If denied, the prosecutor can appeal to the circuit court, which can order the transfer. Sixteen-year-olds accused of murder are automatically tried as an adult in South Carolina. Anderson 4 Superintendent Joanne Avery said staff saved lives by flawlessly implementing active-shooter training drills conducted with students at Townville Elementary, most recently as last week. The shooter then fired toward students on the playground but missed. A teacher who heard the first gunshot was able to get those students safely inside, Avery said. The teacher who was shot and another student who was hit in the foot were treated and released from a hospital, officials said. Relatives of Jacob issued a statement late Thursday saying the boy sustained a major brain injury due to the amount of blood he lost after being shot in the leg. Jacob has been unconscious since arriving at the hospital, his great-aunt Rebecca Hunnicutt told WYFF. Classes are scheduled to resume at the school Monday. Please read our Commenting Policy first.

The initial call came from a teacher at the school reporting that an armed male was on the school grounds and a student had been shot, said Taylor Jones, Anderson County emergency services director, during a news conference on Wednesday evening. The gunman armed with a handgun never entered the school and the incident happened on the playground, said Keith Smith deputy chief with Anderson County Sheriff's Office. Another news conference is scheduled for 9 p.m. The suspect was apprehended within minutes, said Anderson District 4 Superintendent Joanne Avery. The school will be closed the rest of the week, Avery said. Children were taken to Oak Dale Baptist Church in Townville after the shooting, where they were picked up by parents. Osborne was found at his residence by family members who called 911, said Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore. The home is a short distance from the school.

The teachers, school staff and law-enforcement handled the situation professionally, after having just gone through a drill recently, Caudell said. A woman could be heard crying loudly at the scene. Osborne Road is a gravel road surrounded by farmland. Reporters have been moved away from the Osborne Road scene to nearby Fairplay Road. EMS and LifeFlight responded to the scene along with units from multiple law enforcement agencies, and a LifeFlight helicopter with at least one patient aboard was seen leaving the scene. The incident was first reported about 1:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to the Oconee County Sheriff's Office. Witnesses on social media reported seeing dozens of emergency vehicles speeding up State 24 toward the school. Units from multiple law enforcement agencies responded, including the South Carolina Highway Patrol, Anderson City Police, and the sheriff's offices Anderson and Oconee counties. The line of parents in cars waiting to pick up their children at Oak Dale Baptist Church stretched for more than a half-mile. Parents were fighting back tears as they waited for their children to be released to them. Michelle Bush was picking up her two children, a second grader and a third-grader. Parent David Walton told a reporter he was relieved to see his daughter walk off the bus after the shooting. Townville Elementary School is in Anderson County District 4. It has 286 students in pre-kindergarten through 6th grade, according to the state Department of Education. The school is at 105 Townville School Road, off Highway 24 near Lake Hartwell and the Georgia state line. The school does not have a resource officer, but has had extensive active-shooter training, Avery said. This is the second school-related shooting in the Upstate this year. A teenager at Southside High School in Greenville County was accidentally shot on May 13 after a gun went off in the cafeteria. Four students were charged in the case. The Oconee County school district requested law enforcement presence Thursday at every elementary school in the county to reassure parents and students that the schools are safe, Sheriff Mike Crenshaw said.

But it is the responsibility of law enforcement to advocate security to state lawmakers and local government officials. Sheriffs and police chiefs, whose ideas will be packaged and presented to Scott for potential action, bluntly talked of the need to increase funding to expand the number of school-resource officers, along with revamping how emergency drills are conducted. Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco noted that fire alarm drills have been conducted in his county the same way since 1958, while campuses are now designed in vast expanses using multiple buildings. At the same time, as school districts struggle with funding, not every school is equipped with an armed resource office. Nocco noted that Pasco County has 92 public and charter schools and 37 resource officers. The workshops --- the others were focused on education and mental health --- were held at locations away from the Capitol, where students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were speaking out for gun-control legislation. Scott has called for FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign after the federal agency acknowledged protocols were not followed when it received a tip in January about Cruz potentially posing a threat. In early 2017, Cruz, then 18, legally purchased an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which was used in the Parkland school shooting.

ANDERSON COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Lives were changed forever at an Anderson County elementary school by mid-afternoon on September 28th. A 14-year-old boy is accused of shooting and killing his father before driving to Townville Elementary School in Anderson County and firing shots into a playground of children, striking two students and a teacher. One of the victims died days later. They want to take a look back to see what we can do better in case the unthinkable were to ever happen again. Stoller was one of the first responders on the scene at Townville Elementary School that September afternoon. Stoller walked into a classroom to find 6-year-old Jacob Hall on his back with firefighters and the school nurse surrounding him. Two tourniquets kept Jacob from bleeding out at the scene. He was airlifted to a hospital for emergency surgery. He was taken off life support a few days later. Now, law enforcement agencies across the state are joining Anderson County to take a look back and review what happened in an effort to collaborate and figure out where we go from here. Taylor says the first step is training administrators and teachers what to do if a lockdown occurs. Many schools have lockdown drills monthly so that the practice becomes perfection for teachers, students, and staff. According to South Carolina Department of Education officials, every district in South Carolina has done some sort of active shooter training. Officials say Townville Elementary School had just done a refresher days before the shooting. But, the consensus among law enforcement and school officials is this: no matter how fast the response time and how much training is done, children and teachers are vulnerable targets. Anderson County officials say they have the beginning of the answer. Jones has been in law enforcement for 35 years. He believes that the first step to saving lives is equipping every teacher and student with the knowledge to respond to an emergency blood loss scenario. Inside the kits are combat-grade trauma tools to stop the bleeding. In South Carolina, we just passed a law within the last twelve months requiring that every senior graduating high school have that training. Stoller and Taylor hope in the aftermath, this training becomes a requirement by law, too. Copyright 2016 WIS. All rights reserved.

The measure was added to state law in light of recent school shootings where armed attackers tripped fire alarms to lure students out of classrooms, making them easy targets. Nineva-Hensley-Jackson Schools Superintendent Dr. Tim Edsell says his district already has plans to adopt the evacuation option into their safety plan. The evacuation delay option is just the latest safety discussion to address fire alarms in schools. Earlier this year, talk was brewing on social media about getting rid of fire alarm pull stations inside schools. A position statement by the Indiana Fire Chiefs Association said fire chiefs around the state were being asked how to officially and safely remove pull-stations in a school building. Those conversations prompted a message of caution from some fire officials. The law addressing fire evacuation delays leaves room for schools to adopt locally-specific safety plans, and several districts are still working on those. In the event of a fire alarm, Perry Township Schools officials say teachers are being instructed to check hallways before evacuating classrooms, but the district does not plan to officially adopt a three-minute delay. Avon Community School officials declined to release specific details of their safety plans, but district spokesperson Stacy Moore released a statement on the issue. White River Township Fire Chief Jeremy Pell says he and other public safety officials are currently consulting with Center Grove Schools on the matter. His initial reaction to the evacuation delay option is positive. Pell said discussions with Center Grove about the evacuation policy are still ongoing.

One of the injured students, six-year-old Jacob Hall, died on Oct. 1 after three days on life support. Funeral services for Jacob were held on Wednesday. Anderson County District 4 Superintendent Joanne Avery said teachers returned to work at Townville Elementary on Monday and counselors instructed them on how best to answer questions from children and shape lesson plans in wake of the tragedy. Parents are also welcome to have breakfast with their children at the school. Avery said counselors will be on hand to speak with parents and students, Therapy dogs will also visit all classrooms on Thursday and Friday mornings. There will also be a heavier law enforcement presence both inside and out of the school.

Avery asked for continued prayers and students and staff settle back in for the rest of the school year. She released the following statement after the return to school: This morning students at Townville Elementary returned to school for the first time since the tragic shooting on Wednesday, September 28. The day began with classroom visits from counselors and therapy dogs, which provided for lots of smiles and calmed the nerves of both teachers and students. As Superintendent, I am pleased that there were only ten absences. Our parents demonstrated resilience, trust, and support for our Townville community school. We thank them for their faith in us and our ability to protect their children. We appreciate the support of area counselors, therapy dogs, law enforcement officers, first responders, and pastors who were onsite to help parents, teachers and students today. We will continue to provide these services until there is no longer a need for them. Beginning today, there is a law enforcement presence both inside and outside of the school. We are attempting to find a healthy balance. The support from the Anderson Sheriff's Office is deeply appreciated as we bridge the gap until we are able to place a permanent SRO in this school in the upcoming weeks. Many of you have asked how you can donate or how your money might be used in a meaningful way. As many of you know, the incident took place next to the playground where children were playing.

Independent-Mail Published 11:39 a.m. One of the victims, 6-year-old Jacob Hall, was on life support Friday night at Greenville Health System Children's Hospital, about 35 miles away. The hearing in the family division of South Carolina's 10th Judicial Circuit Court did not address whether the prosecution will move to try the teen as an adult. USA TODAY does not normally name juveniles charged with a crime unless they face charges in adult court. The boy's father, Jeffrey Osborne, 47, was found dead at around 1:45 p.m. Wednesday at his home, shortly before news of the shooting at Townville Elementary School surfaced. A bullet from the Townville Elementary School shooter hit Jacob Hall, 6, of Townville, S.C., in the femoral artery. (Photo: Courtesy of Renae Hall) In court, Frank Eppes of Greenville, lawyer for the teen, said the 14-year-old previously had given a statement to police and warned law-enforcement officers that the teen should not be asked to give a statement without his lawyer present. No details of what happened before or during the shootings were disclosed in the hearing. Prosecutors had asked that the hearing be closed but a lawyer for the Anderson Independent Mail, The Greenville News and other news organizations attended the proceedings to ensure that the public had access. The 10th Judicial Circuit Solicitor's Office said South Carolina law allows prosecutors to seal court records in the case because it involves a juvenile. Another hearing is expected in the next 40 days, Eppes said. Whether multiple 911 calls placed during the shootings will be made public will be decided next week, said Lt. Sheila Cole of the Anderson County Sheriff's Office. While two of the victims, a first-grade teacher and 6-year-old student, were wounded Wednesday and have been treated and released, the bullet that hit Jacob in the leg found his femoral artery. The shootings began when the 14-year-old's grandparents received a cryptic cellphone call from their grandson, authorities have said. They couldn't understand him, so they went next door to check on him, finding Jeffrey Osborne's body but no sign of the teen. Once there, he aimed at a door opening to let students out for recess. Another teacher was able to get students already on the playground safely inside even though the teen had shot at them. Jacob was revived twice in the moments after the shooting, according to state Rep. Alan Clemmons, a Myrtle Beach Republican who said he is a friend of the family.

But the canisters had no detonation device, and the pressure cooker had no explosive material, Henry said. Authorities offered no motive, but they said in a probable-cause affidavit that the suspect had admitted to carrying out the shooting. Pagourtzis, who appeared to have no prior arrests or confrontations with law enforcement, made his initial court appearance on murder charges Friday by video link from the Galveston County Jail. A judge denied bond and took his application for a court-appointed attorney. It was also the deadliest assault in Texas since a man with a semi-automatic rifle attacked a rural church late last year, killing more than two dozen people. Meanwhile, students were being let back inside Santa Fe High School to gather belongings they abandoned when the gunfire began. Braun and other officials declined to answer questions about the investigation. Although most of the dead had not been publicly identified, relatives and acquaintances said the fatalities included a substitute teacher and a foreign exchange student from Pakistan.

Some of the children ran into classrooms to hide from the boy with the gun. Some ran out of the building, into the fields, across the streets, through the doors of nearby businesses. Parents left cars on both sides of an adjacent road, desperately trying to find their teenagers; business owners pulled fleeing children to safety; a state trooper rushed to the school, terrified he would find his own daughter among the dead. Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said authorities would not yet identify the 15-year-old, now in police custody, who he said walked into school armed with a pistol and just before 8 a.m. and immediately started firing. Caporali was eating breakfast in the cafeteria when she heard a shot, turned and saw the teenager with the gun. She knew him as a quiet boy who played music and always seemed happy. After the first shot, she said he seemed to hesitate, but then he fired every bullet in the gun. READ MORE: Student arrested after Texas high school shooting injures 1 Out in the commons, two 16-year-olds, Lexie Waymon and Baleigh Culp, had been laughing and talking about makeup and the homecoming basketball game like ordinary teenagers on an ordinary morning. They heard the first bang, and imagined something equally ordinary, like a heavy book hitting the floor. Fear momentarily seized Waymon. I got up and tried to run, but I fell. I heard someone hit the ground. She froze, she said. Then she came to and ran. Waymon did not stop running, even though her chest hurt. Culp was running, too. She ran to the highway, hearing shot after shot behind her. She was still running, unsure what to do, when a man reached out from the door of a business and pulled her inside, where dozens of other students were hiding. He estimated that 50 to 100 students who ran from the school huddled there, eventually including his own 16-year-old son. Inside school, the boy kept firing, said Caporali, who ran into a classroom. Then he took off running, trying to get away, she said. He was soon apprehended and led away in handcuffs. But by then, more than a dozen had been shot and others were injured as they ran from the gunfire. Holt died at the scene and Cope died after being taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Five others remained in critical condition late Tuesday. Hours after the shooting, Benton residents gathered in a church. The case against the suspect will begin in juvenile court, which is closed to the public and the records sealed under Kentucky law. Prosecutors will request to move it to adult court, at which point the details would no longer be secret. The teen is being held at a regional juvenile jail in Paducah, Kentucky, about a half-hour away, authorities said, and he has been appointed an attorney. Marshall County Attorney Jeff Edwards heard the news from a friend and immediately drove to the building. He and his wife both graduated from the school, as did their children. He saw teenagers running in every direction. He said his heart broke for the ordeal he knows they must endure. He took office in 1997, the year a student opened fire in a school in Paducah, killing three and injuring five. It was two years before the fatal attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, before mass school shootings became all too common. It left scars across the state.

Stuart Elementary as Barack Obama Elementary School, WTVR reported. The top three finalists were Barack Obama, Northside and Wishtree, the station reported. Also on Monday, the Tulsa, Oklahoma, school board voted to rename Columbus and Chouteau elementary schools, but delayed the vote on what to call another elementary school that is named for Confederate general Robert E. Lee, KRJH reported. Columbus Elementary, named for the now-controversial 15th century explorer, will become Dolores Huerta Elementary, named after the activist who co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with Cesar Chavez. Chouteau Elementary, named for trader and purported slave owner Jean-Pierre Chouteau, according to KTUL, will become Wayman Tisdale Fine Arts Academy, named for a local basketball star who became an NBA player and later a successful jazz musician before his death in 2009. The Tulsa school board approved a change for Robert E. Lee Elementary, but will decide on a new name at its next meeting in August, KJRH reported. A debate surrounding what to do with Confederate names, statues and symbols has been underway in recent years since Dylann Roof killed nine African-Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015. And it flared up again after white nationalists marched during the summer to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a counterprotester was killed.

Yes, of course. But there must be more to it. What I see is hypocrisy in media, politics, in public and private lives as well. In our society we no longer deal with facts. We take it to courts. We let lawyers deal with problems. We come to a doctor and the first thing that we have to sign is HIPAA statement. We are not supposed to trust anybody and we should not suppose that anybody trusts us. I see that our schools do not deal with these things. I believe, that these are the real underlying problems that we pay our politicians and our institutions for. They are failing us. I do not have an answer what to do however, these are the width and breadth of that we have to consider if we all collectively want to start finding a solution.

He brought this upon himself. The mind is a VERY powerful thing. And so many people are born with mental illness and others develop it because of traumatic events, dark secrets, bullying and more. He will have to live with it forever. If he was your child you would want empathy and sympathy for him. You would want the adults in charge of his care and responsible for his fate to be considerate of the fact that he had to be in a dark, dark place to do something like this. Simply saying he is a child. That alone says something about how we need to proceed in this case. Find out the issue first. THEN lay out a punishment and a plan. Yeah his parents screwed up not teaching him better responsibilities and respect of weapons. I, myself, grew up around weapons (being that my dad was an avid wild game hunter), but i knew better than to mess with his guns, when i was a child, plus I was far from being the popular kid in middle school, as i too was picked up and bullied. But instead of taking my frustrations out with violence, I found other positive outlets to relieve my tension and stress. Yall afraid and shoot us but your kids killing babies at schools and shooting up theaters just because you cant get your way, sad sad. At least the Mother should be there.

Five people are dead, including the attacker, and 10 wounded after a string of shootings Tuesday morning in at least seven locations in remote Tehama County, about 125 northwest of Sacramento, Assistant Sheriff Phil Johnston said. The gunman, who has not been publicly identified, tried to enter Rancho Tehama Elementary School, which was on lockdown, Johnston said. The gunman had a tactical vest with extra magazines for his guns, Johnston said. The incident at the school lasted about six minutes, said Johnston, who viewed surveillance video of the shooting. Police killed the gunman after a shooting spree that appears to have begun with a dispute with a neighbor and ended in a roadside gunfight with police, Johnston said. The woman was being treated for life-threatening injuries. A child who was in the vehicle was not seriously wounded, according to Johnston. Hours into an investigation that involves the FBI, the ATF and California Highway Patrol, the motive for the shootings remains unclear. We commend the effort of courageous law enforcement. He said there was a report of a domestic violence incident involving the man on Monday. He said the man had a dispute with a female neighbor who died Tuesday. When the gunman arrived at the school, he fired multiple rounds into the building. He stole a truck and commandeered another vehicle from a motorist at gunpoint, Johnston said. There were reports that the shooter carried out random drive-by shootings on residences. Authorities said the suspect rammed a fence and a gate at the school and probably grew frustrated that he couldn't get into the school. It was unclear whether the gunman went there looking for someone he knew. Some students were transported to hospitals by helicopter, and others were moved to a safe location in a school bus,the assistant sheriff's said. The children were later reunited with their parents. Three children and an adult are being treated at Enloe Medical Center in Chico, officials said. Their conditions were not available. A semi-automatic rifle and two handguns believed to be used by the gunman have been recovered, according to Johnston. There is another gun that police have yet to recover in one of the stolen vehicles. Johnston complimented the officers who stopped the gunman.

Nikolas Cruz, the Stoneman Douglas gunman, was suspended at least 67 days over less than a year and a half at Westglades Middle School, and his problems continued at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, until he finally was forced to leave. Megan O'Matz and Scott TravisContact ReportersSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Broward Schools have grown so tolerant of misbehavior that students like Nikolas Cruz are able to slide by for years without strict punishment for conduct that could be criminal. Cruz was suspended at least 67 days over less than a year and a half at Westglades Middle School, and his problems continued at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, until he finally was forced to leave. -- Lenient discipline has an added PR benefit for the district: lower suspensions, expulsions and arrests along with rising graduation rates. Facing significant legal and political exposure over the shooting at Marjory... The program, the pride of Superintendent Robert Runcie, was designed to use counseling and mentoring to help students avoid the school-to-prison pipeline. Under former zero-tolerance policies, black students ended up suspended, expelled and arrested at rates that were widely disproportionate to their peers. Mary Fitzgerald taught for 37 years in the district before retiring from Sunrise Middle in Fort Lauderdale in 2016. She said she retired a year early due to her concerns about student discipline. I had three students bring knives to my classroom. One was out of the classroom for one day. Another had so many things on his record, he was gone for five days. Nikolas Cruz, 19, faced a judge Thursday... Safety concerns at Sunrise were brought up at faculty meetings. The Promise program The Pine Ridge Education Center, just outside Fort Lauderdale, houses the Promise program, as well as secure classrooms for other children who have been expelled from their regular school but need supervision and guidance. Yiran Zhu Yiran Zhu Runcie claims the Promise program has a 90 percent success rate at keeping children from re-offending, but that statistic can be deceiving. The following year, they start with a clean slate. Yiran Zhu Yiran Zhu Asked about kids starting each year anew, without marks against them from prior semesters, Runcie told the Sun Sentinel he will review it. It was designed to help staff make fairer and more equitable decisions in handing out penalties. But potential punishments have become more lenient over the years. More than five years ago, a high school student who used profanity toward a staff member would receive a three- to 10-day suspension. That was reduced to one to two days after the discipline chart was revised. The first violation for disruptive classroom behavior called for an in-school suspension of one to five days. Later, it was reduced to a suspension of under one day. Yiran Zhu Yiran Zhu Since the 2012-13 school year, suspensions have declined 27 percent, according to the Florida Department of Education. Incidents reported to law enforcement have fallen 8 percent. The number of arrests per 1,000 students: down 64 percent. Or another option: the Promise program. But the program is under attack because of widespread allegations that Cruz, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school shooter, benefited from it. Runcie had insisted that Cruz was not in the Promise program, but he did an abrupt shift this week and said Cruz had been referred to it in 2013 for vandalizing a bathroom. The Broward County School District now says that gunman Nikolas Cruz was once referred to a program that provides alternatives to arrests, contradicting earlier statements made by Superintendent Robert Runcie. School district spokeswoman Tracy Clark said in a statement that, on Friday, the district... A couple of months later, he was sent to a special school for children with severe emotional and behavioral disorders. As a tot, he was found to be developmentally delayed and had been considered a special needs child in school, entitled to certain services and protections under law. Some parents and community leaders have criticized the superintendent for misleading the public about Cruz, and the school district appears not to be able to make sense of all of the records it has on him. A video on social media shows him with a bullet at school. Police reports have him batting his elderly mother with a vacuum hose, destroying property and pulling a gun on her and his brother. Yiran Zhu Yiran Zhu Runcie disputes that the discipline matrix is too soft on kids. For example, it used to be that a student suspended for vandalism would be sitting at home or wandering the streets, he said. Now they are assigned to an intense program through Promise to help correct their behavior But Fitzgerald, the former Sunrise Middle school teacher, thinks discipline has become lax."}

The meeting was closed to the media, but afterward, Abbott read a long list of ideas discussed. They included: Enlarging the school marshal program, which allows trained school personnel to carry weapons on campus Greater parental accountability Creation of more threat assessment teams Hiring more school counselors Making it easier for students to report potential problems, possibly by rewarding them Installing metal detectors Mental health evaluations starting as early as elementary school Abbott said he hoped some of the ideas could be implemented by the start of the next school year, such as the improved threat assessment system that would allow schools across Texas to better share information. But Abbott insisted the roundtables were not political window dressing. The meetings were prompted by the slaying of 10 people last week at Santa Fe High School. Authorities said student Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, walked into the school with a shotgun and a pistol and killed eight students and two teachers. He is charged with capital murder of multiple people and aggravated assault on a public servant but has not entered a plea. Abbott started the meeting in Austin by discussing the format. Participants will change each day. The Wednesday discussion, for example, will include legislative leaders and the lieutenant governor, judges, the commissioner of the Texas Education Agency, mental health experts, the director of the Texas School Safety Center at Texas State University and members of groups advocating for and against increased gun regulation. After the discussions, reporters came back in and Abbott talked about what happened. The public is invited to share their opinions about improving school safety by going to the state government website.

Abbott said the two guns used in the attack were owned legally by his father. It was not clear whether the father knew his son had taken them. He was referring to the Feb. 14 school shooting in Florida and one in November inside a church in a town near San Antonio. But the Marine Corps told The Associated Press it has reviewed its records and found no one by that name as either a recruit or a person in their delayed entry pool. A woman who answered the phone at a number associated with the Pagourtzis family declined to speak with the AP. Classmates described Pagourtzis as quiet, an avid video game player who routinely wore a black trench coat and black boots to class. Those who know him expressed shock he might be involved in the killings.

At that moment, he thought it was just a fire drill, so he and his girlfriend, Daisy Sullivan, walked outside the building with other students. But Auzston said he thought it was odd the school was having another fire drill after having had one about two weeks ago. Auzston said once he was outside, he heard two bangs but thought it was either a door slamming or the lid of a dumpster slamming down. Then he heard three more bangs, and panic set in.

He said the Pagourtzises are members of a nearby parish. He said Pagourtzis knew a lot about guns and remembered him asking which one he should get when he was older.

She's very involved in the schools and she also helped start the group Students and Educators First in order to help all students. Her main concern is student safety. That's why some of the results from the North Carolina Teacher Working Conditions Survey raised a red flag for her. One question in particular gave her major concerns. The question asks teachers if students follow rules of conduct. Grimsley High School, for one, shows a drop of more than 50 percent since 2016. Deaton said. She and other parents brought those concerns to the school board Tuesday night. The school board is going to address school discipline. Every year the district has a work session going over the data of school discipline from the previous school year. A district representative said that meeting did not happen last year, but they are working on setting up a date and time for this year. Deaton hopes the school board and the superintendent will work with parents this year to stop the decline and to hopefully continue to create a safe learning environment for students.

Hundreds of kids weathered the storm that day in the safest building they could find, their school. We now know that was not a safe place for the seven children who were killed inside Plaza Towers Elementary and for the others who were injured. The Joplin, Missouri School District is one of the few districts in the country that faced that critical question head on. May 22, 2011, Sunday afternoon 161 people lost their lives when the deadliest tornado in 60 years crawled through that community decimating 8,000 homes. The Joplin School District was directly in the path. Ten school buildings were damaged, six schools were nearly wiped from their foundations. Joplin is recovering with purpose. District Superintendent Dr. CJ Huff said the district is still in the process of re-building six facilities. Joplin Schools are adding FEMA EF5-rated safe rooms to every school, even the buildings that had no tornado damage. Joplin will have a safe room for every student and staff member in the district, plus community shelters for anyone within a five-minute walk of a school. It sounds like a remarkably expensive undertaking, and it is, but Huff said they had no choice. Parents want some assurance that their children are safe and rightfully so. The math, as always, is complicated. The district also had donations and state and federal help. When it comes to the cost to upgrade and build safe rooms, they got the vast majority of their funding from FEMA. Architect Michael Sapp, of SAPP Design, has been building FEMA shelters in Missouri schools since the 1990s. FEMA money has been a windfall for the schools in Missouri who have used those federal dollars to build community shelters in the schools. The benefits are two-fold when building multi-use shelters; students and staff have a safe place to go and districts get to take advantage of additional year-round space. Irving will have two EF5-rated safe rooms, including a special education classroom which can hold the student staff population of about 550 people and the school gym, which will hold 5,000 members of the surrounding community. When it's all said and done, the district pays less than half of the cost of these multipurpose safe-rooms, in some cases they foot the bill for as little as 15 percent. Re-building with safety as the top priority is not the quickest method. The high school student at Joplin High will start the fall semester at a temporary location, Northpark Mall, for a second year. Administrators were so concerned about safety they purchased temporary storm shelters, concrete boxes which sit in the parking lot of the mall. They are unusual looking but they are EF-5 rated and they are safe places where students and neighbors can take shelter in the event of a violent tornado. They bought them for peace of mind. Joplin Schools wanted their kids to feel safe while they took the time to apply for the FEMA grants and while the city passed a bond issue to pay for massive district re-construction. Get as safe of a place as possible. They are paying for the re-construction with a combination of insurance coverage, state emergency funding, donations and federal funding. However, according to Superintendent Dr. CJ Huff, the bond issue was a tough sell in conservative southwestern Missouri. State statute in Missouri, and Oklahoma, requires a super-majority when it comes to funding school districts. The Joplin bond issue passed by 43 votes. In the Oklahoma City metro area, some districts have taken advantage of FEMA grant funding, while other districts have used bond issue funds to build safe rooms in some schools. Oklahoma City Public Schools There are five safe rooms in Oklahoma City Public School district's 76 school sites: Grant High School, John Marshall High School, Douglass High School, Martin Luther King Elementary School, Wheeler Elementary School. The district also has five schools with underground areas for students and staff: Capitol Hill High School, Heronville Elementary School, Bodine Elementary School, Martin Luther King Elementary School, Eugene Field Elementary School. Putnam City Schools There are zero FEMA-rated safe rooms in Putnam City's 27 schools. Mid-Del Schools There is one safe room in Mid-Del's 25 schools. It's located at Del City Elementary. The district is currently constructing two safe rooms in the following schools: Soldier Creek Elementary (to open school year 2014-15), Midwest City Elementary (to open school year 2014-15). Edmond Public Schools There are eight safe rooms in Edmond's 26 schools: Cross Timbers Elementary, Washington Irving Elementary, West Field Elementary, Angie Debo Elementary, Frontier Elementary, Centennial Elementary, Cheyenne Middle School, Santa Fe High School. Moore Public Schools There are two FEMA approved safe hallways in Moore's 32 schools: Kelley Elementary School (rebuilt in 1999), West Moore High School (addition added in 2000). Norman Public Schools There are tornado shelter areas in eight of Norman's 24 school sites: Alcott Middle School (basement shelter for school capacity), Cleveland Elementary (basement shelter for school capacity), Roosevelt Elementary (safe room hallway), Truman Elementary (3 safe rooms), Truman Primary (FEMA-rated gym safe room), Reagan Elementary (6 safe rooms), Washington Elementary (3 safe rooms), Whittier Middle School (multipurpose safe room).

The teen is being held at the Greenville County Detention Center Juvenile Facility, Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said.

Tim Scott lays flowers at Townville Elementary Pictures: Shooting at Townville Elementary School American Red Cross arrives at church near shooting The shooting happened shortly before 2 p.m. at Townville Elementary School at 105 State Road in Townville in Anderson County, Lt. Sheila Cole, with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office, said. Police radio recording of shooting response ACSO Capt. Garland Major said one of the 6-year-old boys was shot in the foot, the other in the leg and first-grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth in the shoulder. One of the injured boys, Jacob Hall, was airlifted to Greenville Memorial Hospital where he underwent surgery Wednesday afternoon. Jacob died Saturday at 12:56 p.m., Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said. The second boy and the teacher, Meghan Hollingsworth, were taken by ambulance to AnMed. They were treated and released Wednesday, Ross Norton with AnMed said. Pictures from the scene A note on the door of Hollingsworth's home Thursday morning said her family appreciates people's concern. But she asks those coming to her home to respect their privacy. The note says she's not interested in giving any interviews. A truck, believed to have been driven by the teen, crashed into a fence surrounding the playground and was left there. Anderson County Deputy Chief Keith Smith said the shooting happened on the playground and the shooter never got inside the school. Jamie Brock, 30-year veteran volunteer firefighter who responded to the school after the shooting, took down the suspect on the playground, Smith said. Sheriff John Skipper said Brock likely prevented more shots from being fired by confronting the shooter and taking him down. Video: Person is taken into custody at school Patient being airlifted from school Raw video from school Helicopter with school shooting victim arrives at GHS Parent talks about school shooting Emergency official gives update on shooting American Red Cross arrives at church The teen was armed with a handgun, ACSO Capt. Garland Major said. He said the shooting had no racial or terrorist undertones. Investigators said there is no known relationship between the suspected shooter and the victims at the school. Armed officers were at the school about seven minutes after the call and the suspect was in custody in less than an hour, officials said. Shooting suspect's father found dead The Anderson County Coroner's Office is also investigating the death of the shooter's father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Dewitt Osborne at his home on Osborne Road in Townville. The location is a little more than 3 miles from school. Jeffrey Osborne was shot to death, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said. The teen is the suspect in his father's death, Skipper said. Shore said the teen called his grandparents on his cellphone at 1:44 p.m. The grandmother said he was crying and so upset she couldn't understand him, so she and her husband went to Osborne's home to see if their grandson was there. The grandson was not there, but they found their son's body. At 1:45 p.m., a teacher called to report the shooting at the school. Osborne's wife released a statement Thursday morning through her pastor. Impact on the Townville community Dr. Joanne Avery, Anderson County District 4 superintendent, said there are video cameras in the school, and though the school does not have a resource officer, the staff has had lots of active shooter training and that helped during and after the shooting. Avery said school at Townville Elementary is canceled for rest of week and counseling services will be available. Haley arrived in the Upstate Wednesday evening, but she did not make any public appearances. Moments of panic for parents After the shooting, students were evacuated and moved by bus to Oakdale Baptist Church at 6724 Highway 24 in Townville. I don't know. (I) just feel so bad. I don't know how they knew to go in the bathroom, but I know her teacher was shaken up. I know all the kids were scared. There was a bunch of kids crying.

Representatives from several police departments, school districts and communities got together to discuss what they can do to make schools safer, all just months after seeing the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut. We can't. State leaders are working on a bill that would put an armed resource officer in every elementary school across Pennsylvania. But in Lackawanna County, a newly-formed group called C.L.A.S.S. - Children's Lives and Safer Schools - is also working to bring about change in the wake of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary. Angie Scalzo runs a day care and is active with the group. Many school administrators say the best thing about meetings like the one here at Mid Valley High School is that they can exchange ideas with one another, making our schools a bit safer. Many schools have already made security changes since Sandy Hook and we've seen many new protocols in action, every thing from searching students to evacuating buildings as a precaution. And many parents believe conversations like these at Mid Valley are part of the bigger solution. C.L.A.S.S., the Children's Lives and Safer Schools group says it is still getting organized, but members plan to meet about once a month in an effort to find ways to better protect students.

But hospital officials said at least three people, including one adult, were being treated. One student had an ankle fracture. Jowitt said the shooting was reported shortly after 9 a.m. The situation was quickly resolved, and the student was arrested in or near the classroom, police public information officer Lt. Bruce Barnes said. Jowitt said a secondary threat was received at Noblesville High School. Barnes said police are seeking several search warrants in their investigation. Authorities did not release the name of the suspect or the names and conditions of the injured people. Gov. Eric J. Holcomb, who was returning to Indianapolis from a trip to Europe, said in a statement that he was monitoring the situation and that about 100 Indiana State Police officers were made available to work with local authorities. The middle school was on lockdown part of the morning, said Jackie Chatteron, a receptionist for the school district. Aerial news video showed rows of students being evacuated and escorted to school buses. Students were taken to Noblesville High for parents to pick up, state police said. The shooting comes a week after 10 people were killed at a school in Santa Fe, Texas. Noblesville, a town of 60,000, is about 25 miles northeast of Indianapolis.

{"URL_s":"https://kdvr.com/2018/01/23/one-dead-several-wounded-in-kentucky-high-school-shooting","Timestamp_s":"20180819063525","Sentences_t":"-- A 15-year-old student opened fire with a handgun inside his rural Kentucky high school Tuesday, killing two classmates, injuring 17 others and sending hundreds fleeing for safety. Police were seen leading a teenager away in handcuffs. It was the nation's first fatal school shooting of 2018. The shooter will be charged with murder and attempted murder, Kentucky State Police Lt. Michael Webb said. Police did not release any identities, nor did they describe a motive. Webb said detectives are looking into his home and background. Students ran for their lives as the student began shooting inside an atrium just before morning classes would have begun at Marshall County High School. Many jumped into cars or ran down the highway, some not stopping until they reached a McDonald's restaurant more than a mile away. Parents left their cars on both sides of an adjacent road, desperately trying to find their teenagers. A half-dozen ambulances and numerous police cars converged on the school, along with officers in black fatigues carrying assault rifles. Federal authorities responded, and Sen. Mitch McConnell sent staffers. Gov. Matt Bevin rushed from the Capitol to the scene. Two 15-year-olds were killed: A girl died at the scene, and a boy died later at a hospital, the governor said, adding that all of the victims are believed to be students. He said 12 of those injured suffered bullet wounds. Five were flown about 120 miles to Nashville, Tennessee's Vanderbilt University Medical Center, spokeswoman Tavia Smith said. The attack marked the year's first fatal school shooting, 23 days into 2018, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, which relies on media reports and other information. The anti-violence group Everytown for Gun Safety has counted at least 283 shootings at schools since 2013. Marshall County High School is about 30 minutes from Heath High School in Paducah, Kentucky, where a 1997 mass shooting killed three and injured five. Michael Carneal, then 14, opened fire there about two years before the fatal attack at Columbine High School in Jefferson County, ushering in an era when mass school shootings have become much more common. Meanwhile, in the small North Texas town of Italy, a 15-year-old girl was recovering Tuesday after police said she was shot by a 16-year-old classmate in her high school cafeteria on Monday, sending dozens of students scrambling for safety. Tuesday's shooting happened as students gathered in a common area, just before the day's first classes. Sixteen-year-old Lexie Waymon said she and a friend were talking about the next basketball game, makeup and eyelashes when gunshots pierced the air. I couldn't move. I got up and I tried to run, but I fell. I heard someone hit the ground. Like, I could not see anything. I just froze and did not know what to do. Waymon did not stop running, not even when she called her mom to tell her what happened. She made it to the McDonald's, her chest hurting, struggling to breathe. It was chaotic outside the school as parents and students rushed around trying to find each other, said Dusty Kornbacher, who owns a nearby floral shop. Barry Mann said his 14-year-old son was put on a bus and taken to another school to be picked up. Garland said his son, a 16-year-old sophomore, jumped into someone's car and sped away before joining others inside his business. AlertMe Trademark and Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Lois K.

The parents urged Broward residents to vote for their slate of candidates in the Aug. 28 primary. Five of nine school board seats are up for election, and the parents have endorsed candidates in each race. Two parents whose children died, Lori Alhadeff and Ryan Petty, are among the candidates running for the board. During the news conference, the parents declined to call for the resignation of Runcie, whom many residents have faulted for mistakes made since the killings.

After they emerged from the courtroom, the parents of the child huddled with defense attorneys Chris Eskew and Ben Jaffe of Indianapolis who refused comment as they walked with their clients to a third floor elevator following a 20-minute conversation. By state law, juvenile detention and delinquency hearings are confidential. A detention hearing is to determine if the accused youth should remain in protective custody for his or her safety and the security of the community. Following such a hearing, the prosecutor has seven working days to file a petition for delinquency to convince a judge that a crime has been committed and the detained teen is the likely suspect. While community and school sources have identified the suspect as a 13-year-old boy, the Hamilton County Prosecutor has refused comment. Conviction of charges in juvenile court can result in a teen being sentenced to serve a term in a state juvenile facility with the potential of parole at the age of 18. Prosecutors have leniency to determine if criminal charges can be filed against the owner of a firearm that is used in the commission of a felony. Witnesses said the boy left the science classroom at 9 a.m. last Friday and returned minutes later with two guns and began firing, injuring teacher Jason Seaman and classmate Ella Whistler, both of whom are recovering from their injuries.

Wednesday night, the school board voted five to two to close Van Buren and Stansberry Elementary schools after the 2018-19 school year. The areas where those students is live is changing. More often, they live in the eastern and southern part of the district, not in the center where the two schools are closing. Right now, enrollment at Stansberry and Van Buren is about 60 percent and 40 percent of capacity and is predicted to decrease next school year. Stansberry Elementary School is one of two elementary schools closing in the Thompson School District in 2019. She said that makes it very expensive to educate the students and provide them art, music, gifted and special education programs. But not all board members and parents think it's worth the money. Swanty was one of the board members who voted against closing the schools. He would've like to see the district wait longer before making a decision. So would Lora Mann, who's son is in kindergarten at Stansberry Elementary, where he walks to school almost every day. So anytime you want to talk to teachers, you just go right in.

Changes are coming for the good. Reporters were not permitted to witness the meeting. A student faces capital murder charges in the attack. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz, both Republicans, greeted Trump after Air Force One landed at a Houston military base. Abbott joined Trump for the short ride in the presidential limousine to a Coast Guard hangar where the meeting took place. Trump then headed to a fundraiser at a luxury hotel in downtown Houston, the first of his two big-dollar events in Texas on Thursday. A White House official did not immediately respond to requests for details about how much money was to be raised, and who was benefiting, from the fundraising events. After 17 teachers and students were killed during a February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Trump said he would work to improve school safety, but has not called for new gun control legislation. He created the commission to review ways to make schools safer. Abbott, a Republican and a staunch gun-rights supporter, has called for schools to have more armed personnel and said they should put greater focus on spotting student mental health problems. Investigators say student Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, carried out the attack with a shotgun and pistol that belonged to his father. Classes at Santa Fe High School resumed Tuesday for the first time since the shooting. As the Parkland students became vocal advocates for gun control, embracing their public positions as few school survivors had before, Trump quickly became a focal point for their anger. There has yet to be a similar outcry for restrictions on firearms from the students and survivors in deep-red Texas. Displaying empathy does not come naturally to Trump, who has been criticized for appearing unfeeling in times of tragedy, including when he sharply criticized a mayor in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of a deadly hurricane and fought with a Gold Star military family. But Trump has at times displayed a softer side. On Wednesday, he returned a hug from an 8-year-old boy with muscular dystrophy who attended a White House event where he signed legislation to give patients the right to try experimental treatments. Before Thursday, Trump was most recently in the Lone Star State on May 4 to attend the annual National Rifle Association convention. Trademark and Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Over the past five years, about 125,000 teachers, counselors and administrators across the country have been trained in stemming blood loss as school officials have become resigned to the grim trend. The effort is rapidly expanding, and more schools are now stocking classrooms with supplies that would be familiar to any military medic: lightweight tourniquets, gauze coated with blood-clotting drugs and compression bandages. WATCH: Florida police officer tears up after recalling Parkland school shooting Although schools are adding security and even arming teachers to deter attacks, new emphasis is being given to saving the wounded while counting down the minutes until help arrives. The teacher triage idea was initially pushed by Dr. Lenworth Jacobs of Hartford, Connecticut, who operated on victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, in which 26 children and adults were killed. Jacobs and other like-minded surgeons formed a group that expanded to include law enforcement and other first responders who developed strategies for helping victims survive. In many school shootings, more victims could be saved if someone had at least slowed their bleeding. The initiative, dubbed Stop the Bleed, has spread quickly and training is now available in all 50 states. Since last spring, the Georgia Trauma Commission, a state agency that works to improve emergency care, has coordinated the training of more than 18,000 educators. WATCH: Westmount Elementary school student shows support for Florida shooting victims Many teachers who might once have recoiled at becoming a battlefield medic have come around as school security measures have repeatedly failed to prevent shootings. In many cases, the shooters are students themselves who have ready access to the building. And lockdowns can add to the risk of death. In Bend, Oregon, paramedic Nolan McGinnis leapt at the chance to train school personnel on how to treat victims. He was among the first paramedics to arrive at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, after a 2015 shooting that left 10 people dead. Although no shootings have occurred at the school, the now-normal drumbeat of reports about threats, rumors and lockdowns in every region keeps the danger in mind. Trauma care specialist Brian Feist and surgeon Richard Sidwell used a foam limb to demonstrate proper techniques, then gave teachers a chance to practice packing wounds and cinching tourniquets. READ MORE: Florida school shooting victim who used body to shield others released from hospital Feist explained that direct pressure was more effective on especially young children and tourniquets best for multiple wounds. The ultratight straps on a tourniquet could be very painful, he warned. Teacher Denise Gulling noted that kids now accept that shootings could happen.

The outrage ballooned after a lawyer for a student injured in the shooting, Daniela Menescal, 17, filed a petition in Broward court asking that a judge review whether the school district can limit the amount paid to victims in this manner. She is learning to cope with the trauma and the effects of the shooting. Marjory Stoneman Douglas student Daniela Menescal, 17, was hit by shrapnel in the shooting at the school. She is learning to cope with the trauma and the effects of the shooting. Only when she saw the blood did Daniela Menescal grasp what it meant. Her blood seeped from her hip and thigh through her white pants; the blood of others splattered there, too.

Lawlor, who has indicated he is suing the district on behalf of Menescal, also represents two other students who were in the 1200 building, but not injured by gunfire. They do, however, bear psychological scars, he said. The school district is facing potential lawsuits from the families of 17 people killed during the massacre, and from 17 victims who were injured in the shooting. Others who bear psychological trauma have also sought damage claims from the district. Lawlor says each victim of the rampage represents a separate incident. Since the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, governments and businesses have made changes to gun and safety policies in response. The Sun Sentinel will continue tracking changes that been made to federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as... If it were treated as multiple incidents, the cap would apply to each case. She said that other students seeking damage claims will be met with the same response as Menescal. Beyond the state statute limitations, victims can seek further compensation by filing a claims bill through the legislature that would have to pass like any other bill of law. However, Lawlor says the Florida Supreme Court in 2003 ruled that the shooting of a separate victim constituted a separate incident when reviewing the case of a fatal shooting at a fraternity graduation party involving multiple victims. Menescal was in room 1214, her Holocaust history class, when Cruz opened fire through the glass panel in the door. The petite 17-year-old barely managed to hide behind a filing cabinet and was struck by bullet shrapnel that injured her thigh and hip and lower back area. The nearby bodies of classmates Nicholas Dworet and Helena Ramsay lay lifeless. The image of the pair is one Menescal says she will never forget. Even if I try not to think about it every day I do."}

Pierson had asked about a specific teacher when he entered the school armed with a shotgun on December 13. Pierson then fired another round down a hallway, then entered the library, where he fired again and ignited one of the Molotov cocktails, according to Robinson. That ignited at least three bookshelves, causing smoke to pour into the library. JUST WATCHED Police: Shooting took less than 2 min. Police: Shooting took less than 2 min. Police name Colorado school shooter 01:57 By 12:35 p.m., it was all over. He added that, to his knowledge, the shooter and the victim did not know each other. The shooter's target, appeared to have been the librarian, who runs the debate team and who had disciplined Pierson early last September, Robinson said. But the librarian -- accompanied by a janitor -- had departed the school building as soon as the incident began to unfold, he said. The janitor told CNN affiliate KMGH on Friday that the student was wearing tactical gear. That's when I knew. Llerenas said he called security and then escorted the faculty member out of the school. Pierson had fired at the man but missed, Llerenas told KUSA. The rampage might have resulted in many more casualties had it not been for the quick response of a deputy sheriff who was working as a school resource officer at the school, Robinson said. Lessons of Columbine and other school shootings helped in Arapahoe Once he learned of the threat, he ran -- accompanied by an unarmed school security officer and two administrators -- from the cafeteria to the library, Robinson said. The deputy was yelling for people to get down and identified himself as a county deputy sheriff, Robinson said. The shooter's weapons had been purchased legally on December 6 at a local outlet, Robinson said. Robinson also credited the faculty member for having left the school as soon as the threat became apparent. In a statement read by Robinson, Davis's parents said that first responders and the trauma team at Littleton Adventist Hospital had saved her life, but that she remained in critical condition with severe head trauma. Pierson's body remained inside the school until about 5 a.m. Saturday, when the Arapahoe County Coroner's Office removed it. His mother was out of town on family business, but both parents have spoken with investigators, said Robinson, who added that the dead man appeared to have acted alone. Police executed search warrants for Pierson's car and his mother's house and his father's house, though Robinson would not say what may have been found. While Pierson's act may be long remembered, his name will not be, if Robinson has his way. Still, others recalled the shooter with affection and his actions on Friday an aberration. He was an achiever, an athlete who ran cross country, and he had worked on an Eagle Scout project. Frank Woronoff told CNN he had known Pierson since they were freshmen together. After it was clear that Pierson was no longer a threat, police escorted the school's 2,000 students from the buildings. TV crews who by now had descended on the campus en masse showed dozens of students -- their hands in the air -- walking out of the school. Some stood in lines at a field, where they were patted down by police. The students were then taken by bus to a nearby church, where they were reunited with their families, Robinson said.

Jacob was holding the door for others but having trouble with the weight of it, according to testimony, so Meghan Hollingsworth, his first-grade teacher, was helping him. And then, in a blink, everything changed. Pamela Sanchez, a teacher's assistant assigned to Hollingsworth's class, testified about the next moments Tuesday in the Anderson County Courthouse during a waiver hearing for accused shooter Jesse Osborne, now 15. Teacher assistant describes Townville Elementary shooting Pamela Sanchez, a teacher's assistant from Townville Elementary, talks about the shooting at the school in 2016, during a waiver hearing for Jesse Osborne in Anderson on Tuesday, February 13, 2018. Pool video She heard three gunshots, she said. She saw that Jacob wasn't standing anymore. She ran to him. Those may have been the last words he ever uttered. Sanchez picked up Jacob and carried him inside the building. She kept pressure on his leg, but he did not respond. Someone else started CPR. A medical helicopter came for him. But it wasn't enough. Three days later the bespectacled first-grader who believed in superheroes was dead. Sanchez's account was part of an emotional day of testimony. Jacob's father, Rodger Hall, left the courtroom before noon Tuesday because he became too upset to stay. Video played in court from Townville Elementary School on the day of the shooting showed panicked children scrambling to reach safety after shots rang out near the playground. Fireman Brock testifies in Osborne hearing Fireman Jamie Brock talks about the day of the Townville Elementary School shooting during a waiver hearing for Jesse Osborne in Anderson on Tuesday, February 13. Brock, who was armed with a gun, said he discovered Osborne near the playground, pinned him down and placed his knee in Osborne's back to hold him. Rame Campbell, one of Osborne's attorneys, asked Brock if the teen was combative. Brock testified that he spoke to Osborne after he found him. Brock said. Denise Fredericks, the principal of Townville Elementary, where Osborne attended through fifth grade, testified that someone on staff at the school recognized the boy and identified him by name. Fredericks testified that Jesse met normal social, behavioral standards when he was a student at Townville Elementary and that he was never described as having autism. She, too, became emotional during her testimony. Crying could be seen and heard in the audience several times during the proceedings. Osborne, who was 14 at the time of the shooting, is accused of killing his father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne, in their Townville home that day in 2016, then taking his truck to the school about three miles away. Investigators say the teen opened fire on the playground, wounding two 6-year-old students, hurting a third student, and shooting Hollingsworth. Jacob was dressed in a tiny Batman costume for his wake. This week's hearing is to determine whether Osborne will be later tried in the case as a child or adult. Being tried as an adult would open Osborne to more serious punishment if he is found guilty. Family Court Judge Edgar Long could render a decision this week. Osborne's attorneys say he should be tried as a juvenile, and they've contended that his mother should've been present during his interview with investigators, which happened sometime after 8 p.m. on the day of the shooting. They said Osborne had a difficult home life and an especially difficult relationship with his father. Grady Epps, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office's lead investigator in this case, testified that after the shooting he received information that Osborne's father had threatened to kill the teen's pet rabbit, Floppy. Testimony stretched late into the day Tuesday. Just before 6 p.m., FBI Special Agent Shandal Ewing was testifying. Part of her job was to study Jesse Osborne's activities on social media and the internet. She read aloud in court records of messages from September 2016 that appeared to detail a potential plan to carry out a school shooting."}

The statement, issued through a law firm, says the family is cooperating with investigators and will make no other public comments until the fact-finding stage is completed. Pagourtzis is being held without bail and is accused of capital murder of multiple people and aggravated assault on a public servant. He has not entered a plea. Police say Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, used a shotgun and a revolver to shoot students and teachers at Santa Fe High School on Friday morning. Pagourtzis told an investigator he acted alone and spared people he liked because he wanted his story told, a probable cause affidavit says. On Saturday evening, a vigil for the victims is scheduled to be held on the other side of Houston, in the community of Spring. One of the students who was killed was Jared Black, who turned 17 this week and was supposed to have a birthday party Saturday. A family friend told CNN his family learned of his death about 13 hours after the shooting. Officers were escorting people back to the campus Saturday in groups of 10 to collect things such as valuables, keys and vehicles, school district Police Chief Walter Braun said. Fifty had returned to the school by the afternoon. A shotgun and a .38 revolver The gunfire at Santa Fe High School, not far from Houston in southeastern Texas, started Friday morning. The alleged shooter used a shotgun and a .38 revolver legally owned by his father, Gov. Greg Abbott told reporters. Gunfire erupted at the school not long after classes began around 7:30 a.m. local time, officials said. Two school resource officers were on the campus and confronted the shooter, Abbott said. One was a pressure cooker with an alarm clock and nails, but no explosive material. Authorities also found an unlit Molotov cocktail, he said. Investigators on Friday searched a trailer where they believe the devices were assembled, a law enforcement source said. Investigators believe Pagourtzis acted alone, a law enforcement official told CNN on Saturday. Earlier, Abbott and other officials indicated that two other people were being interviewed to see whether they were involved. But authorities now believe those two were not connected to the crime, the official said. Exchange student among those killed The people hospitalized included retired Houston police Officer John Barnes, who served as a resource officer at the school. Barnes was in critical condition, the University of Texas Medical Branch said Saturday. What we know about the shooting This is the 22nd US school shooting so far this year, and the third instance in eight days in which a gunman was on a school campus. Gunshots in an art room, and a fire alarm A student, Damon Rabon, said he was in class when he heard a loud bang next door. Rabon said he followed his teacher, who went to investigate. They heard three more bangs and saw the shooter come out of an art room. They went back into their classroom and told others to help barricade the door. A substitute teacher, David Briscoe, said he was teaching an English class when he heard screaming and gunshots, then a fire alarm. Not knowing where the shooter was, he barricaded his classroom door with tables and desks, turned off the lights and told his students to get down. He told CNN he could hear someone outside the room groaning, apparently injured. Angelica Martinez, 14, told CNN that an alarm sounded, as well as gunfire. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told CNN affiliate KPRC that she heard gunshots after the alarm blared. Too many years. Trump said federal authorities are coordinating with local officials.

Media outlets, including the South Florida Sun Sentinel, argued that the video should be released as a public record that may shed light on the law enforcement response to the shooting as it unfolded. Shooter Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school, faces the death penalty if convicted of 17 counts of first-degree murder. During his rampage, he also wounded 17 other victims. The footage under review specifically does not include anything depicting victims or the shooting itself. Broward Circuit Judge Jeffrey R. Levenson had already released some video in March. It showed then-School Resource Officer Scot Peterson, a deputy, standing and waiting outside the school building during the shooting. Peterson was heavily criticized for his response and resigned days after the shooting. He has been named as a defendant in one federal lawsuit and at least one state lawsuit filed by victims of the tragedy. The non-stop coverage... Levenson ultimately agreed, finding that the value to the public outweighed the concerns of the school board and prosecutors. The attorney for the Broward School Board did not reply to a request for comment. Two other judges are considering how much information to release to the public in the Parkland school shooting case. The report was commissioned by the school board to determine whether officials could or should have known enough to intervene before the shooting. And in the criminal case, Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer has been asked by the defense to block the public release of the statement Cruz gave to investigators following his arrest on Feb. 14. Both judges said they will give lawyers a chance to appeal their rulings once they have decided."}

What we know about the shooting Early morning attack Gunfire erupted at the school, about 20 miles outside Galveston, not long after classes began around 7:30 a.m. CT, officials said. The suspect is believed to be a student. The male that Gonzalez described as a suspect was injured, a law enforcement official said on condition of anonymity. Investigators believe that the second person, an 18-year-old, may be an accomplice but not a shooter, a law enforcement official said. Two law enforcement officers are among the injured, according to a law enforcement source. One man is in critical condition with a gunshot wound in one of his arms, said David Marshall, chief nursing officer for University of Texas Medical Branch hospital. This is the 22nd US school shooting since the beginning of the year, and the third instance in eight days in which a gunman was on a school campus. Authorities found explosive devices in the high school and in adjacent areas, said Walter Braun, Santa Fe Independent School District police chief. Investigators Friday afternoon were searching a trailer where they believe the devices were assembled, a law enforcement source said. The school has been cleared of all students and staff, who have been directed to a nearby facility to reunite with their families, Braun said. Witness: Shooter fired gun in an art class An armed person walked into an art class at the school and began firing what looked like a shotgun, a witness told CNN affiliate KTRK. The witness told KTRK she saw a girl shot in the leg. Victims were being treated at three hospitals, authorities said. Eight people went to Clear Lake Regional Medical in Webster, Texas; two patients were treated at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City; and four patients went to John Sealy University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. It is unclear whether they were all wounded. Six of the eight patients at Clare Lake Regional were discharged by Friday afternoon. A witness who spoke to KTRK also said she heard an alarm. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told CNN affiliate KPRC that she heard gunshots only after hearing an alarm in the school. MaKenna Evans, a 16-year-old sophomore, told CNN she was in geometry class when the shooting started. First, she heard a fire alarm, she said. When the students got outside, her principal told them all to run. Evans said students hid behind a building across the street from the school.

The two-day training, conducted by the St. Louis County Police Department's Tactical Operations Unit, has been held in small groups throughout the summer to maximize learning potential. Officer Mike Schira has been a school resource officer going on six years. When a crisis occurs on school property, school resource officers are generally first on the scene. They are often alone, with limited knowledge and without extensive tactical gear. Sondag said school resource officers are also expected to manage countless students and faculty by helping them navigate where to go while also working to stop the threat. The training is modeled after real-world incidents. However, when news breaks of another school shooting, Schira immediately begins to play out how he would respond to the scenario if it happened in his own schools. Schira said much of the training is focused on awareness and communication, two areas that can often become clouded during a crisis. Sondag said they run through a variety of active scenarios as well as training using the county's virtual shooting simulator and at the gun range. While these active shooter training sessions are important, he is proactive in getting to know and building relationships with students and faculty to help prevent the situations from getting to that point. In addition to the school resource officers, the entire St. Louis County Police Department and several municipalities will go through similar active shooter training this year.

Volunteer firefighter Jamie Brock was able to subdue the shooter. The shooting began Wednesday afternoon in a rural area of Townville near the Georgia-South Carolina line. Authorities say the teenager killed his father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne, and then drove to Townville Elementary School, about two miles away. Joey Taylor walks with his daughter Josie Taylor after picking her up at Oakdale Baptist Church on Wednesday, Sept. 28, 2016, in Townville, S.C. Students were evacuated to the church following a shooting at Townville Elementary School. A teenager opened fire at the South Carolina elementary school Wednesday. She said the shooter never entered the school. Teachers then led the students to safety inside. McAdams gave a harrowing account of the moments after officials received a 911 call at 1:45 p.m. from a teacher in a Townville Elementary classroom, reporting the gunman on school grounds. McAdams said they immediately noticed a black pickup truck that was crashed into the playground area. Once they checked inside the truck and found no one inside, the two heard teachers asking for help for wounded students inside. Brock suggested McAdams, a paramedic, go inside to offer medical assistance, while Brock continued to search for the gunman. Hollingsworth, McAdams said, was one of the teachers who had earlier helped usher students to safety despite her injuries. McAdams said he and a school nurse tended to the boy until other agencies arrived to assist them, and the child was transported via LifeFlight to a pediatric trauma center. Hollingsworth and another 6-year-old boy, who had been shot in the foot, were transported via ambulance to a hospital. Around the same time, unbeknownst to McAdams, he said Brock had encountered the gunman near a rear corner of the school. He asked for prayers for Jacob Hall, who remained in critical condition Thursday. Authorities also said audio from the 911 calls made after the shootings will not be released while the investigation is ongoing. Jacob Hall, 6, has been identified as one of the victims of the Townville, S.C., shooting on Sept. 28, 2016. When they got there, they found Osborne dead and their grandson gone. About one minute later, authorities received a 911 call from a teacher inside the school. Television images showed officers swarming the school after the report of an active shooter. Some were on top of the roof while others were walking around the building. Students were driven away on buses accompanied by police officers to a nearby church. The sheriff said the teen had been homeschooled. One of the students and the teacher were released from the hospital Wednesday evening, AnMed Health spokeswoman Juana Slade said. The school surrounded by working farms has about 300 students in its pre-kindergarten to sixth-grade classrooms. About 90 percent of the students are white, according to state records. We are praying and will continue to do so for the two precious children who were wounded, and for their courageous teacher who was wounded while rescuing the children. We cannot express the devastation we feel at the loss of our beloved Jeff. We are thankful to have friends who have expressed their sympathy and support 2 Tiffney that the loss of her husband.

He did not know who the truck the teen drove was registered to and declined to say how many shots were fired. Garland Major said. Both students were male. The teacher was hit in the shoulder. She canceled classes at the school for the rest of the week. Television images showed officers swarming the school after the report of an active shooter. Some were on top of the roof while others were walking around the building. Students were driven away on buses accompanied by police officers to a nearby church. The sheriff said the teen had been homeschooled. One of the students and the teacher were released from the hospital Wednesday evening, AnMed Health spokeswoman Juana Slade said. Greenville Health System spokeswoman Sandy Dees said the other student, Jacob Hall, remained in critical condition. The school surrounded by working farms has about 300 students in its pre-kindergarten to sixth-grade classrooms. About 90 percent of the students are white, according to state records. Media.

There was no information released on the identities or conditions of the victims, who were taken to hospitals in Indianapolis. Indiana University Health spokeswoman Danielle Sirilla said the teacher was taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital and the wounded student was taken to Riley Hospital for Children. The attack comes a week after an attack at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed eight students and two teachers, and months after the school attack that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida.

Keri Gienger went to school at Kapowsin and now her children do, too. The 9-year-old has the lockdown drill memorized. As Keri does her part, so is the Bethel School District. Before the upgrades, a teacher would have to physically come out of the classroom and use a key to lock a classroom door. Starting this fall, a teacher can lock a classroom from the inside without a key. The quick and simple way to lock a classroom could save precious minutes during a threat. From doors to windows, the risk manager looks for ways to harden schools from an attack. If there is a lockdown, the librarian can pull the blinds over windows. They also installed peep holes on all 201 portable classrooms so students and teachers know who is on the other side. Superintendent Tom Siegel says all the upgrades so far are expensive but worth it. Siegel says if voters approve a bond in November, a portion of it would go toward creating a secondary vestibule or wall near the lobbies of each school. It would complement a security system they already have in place outside of their schools. During school hours, every visitor has to show ID and get buzzed in through a video phone. Risk consultant Jeff Slotnick of Setracon says more schools should be paying attention to what the Bethel School District is doing. Slotnick says the disparity in physical security from one school to another is surprising. Slotnick said. Slotnick says we have state standards when it comes to things like fires so why not one for school shootings. He wants to lobby the Legislature to create a basic set of regulatory requirements for all schools to follow. Bethel schools are not waiting for state requirements to change. Instead they are doing them voluntarily so that this fall, students can feel a little bit safer. Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email."}

Two 6-year-old children were injured, one critically, along with a teacher in the shooting, which happened about 1:45 p.m. Jeffrey Osbourne, the father of the teenager, was found shot to death at a home about 3.5 miles away, said Capt.Garland Major of the Anderson County Sheriff's Office and Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore. One of the children and the teacher, Meghan Hollingsworth, have been released from AnMed Health Medical Center. A Townville fire station volunteer firefighter who stopped the shooting, Jamie Brock, said Chief Deputy Keith Smith of the Sheriff's Office. Brock, who has been a firefighter for about 30 years, was not armed and it was not clear whether the shooter's gun had a malfunction. Katrina Jones said her son, Aden, and her 6-year-old niece are students at Townville Elementary. Her niece was in the group of students who were headed out to the playground for recess Wednesday afternoon. Emergency medical workers and firefighters, in addition to Brock, saved lives at the school, said Taylor Jones, Anderson County's emergency services director. Classes have been cancelled at the school for the rest of the week, said Anderson County District 4 Superintendent Joanne Avery. She said the school has locked doors and cameras, which will be used in the investigation. Avery said counseling will be made available to students, who will be contacted through alerts from the school. It is not clear whether the alleged shooter has a previous criminal history. The teenager was home-schooled and was not a student in any Anderson County school, according to the Sheriff's Office. Oconee County Sheriff Mike Crenshaw confirmed that his agency worked a case in March at West Oak Middle School involving a teenager who brought a hatchet and machete to the school. The teenager was expelled from the school in Westminster. Asked if the March case involved the same teenager who is the alleged shooter in Townville, Crenshaw said he could not answer because the boy's record in that March case had been sealed. He referred additional questions about the matter to the 10th Judicial Circuit Solicitor's Office and to the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice. After the school shooting, 280 students were evacuated. Many went to a nearby church, where they were reunited with their family. A SWAT team cleared the school building after the shooting, which was reported by a teacher. Officials were at the school within seven minutes. The shooting of Osbourne was reported by his parents shortly after the school shooting was reported. Shore said that after the teen gunman shot his father, he stole a truck of one of the relatives.

From tablets and cell phones to computers, they grow up using technology. Schools are trying to keep up with that trend by adding technology like Smart Boards to their classrooms. Unfortunately, funding has not been able to keep up with demand and many elementary schools are left without. But, Pleasant Garden Elementary School has been able to keep up with the curve. Principal Brian Lehman says the school staff and parents have been working with the community on several fundraisers. So far, the school has outfitted the third, fourth, and fifth-grade classrooms with smart boards, and by the end of the year, they hope to have all classrooms included. Principal Lehman says it all because the community cares. We understand that there are generations of students that have come through. I have third graders that have grandparents and great-grandparents that went to high school here when this was a high school. Lehman said. To help finish raising the rest of the money needed, the school is hosting a 5K walk and run on April 14 in Pleasant Garden.

April Schentrup, who lost her 16-year-old daughter Carmen in the Parkland shooting, will be reassigned from principal of Pembroke Pines Elementary to director of school safety and security. Megan O'MatzContact ReporterSouth Florida Sun Sentinel Privacy Policy The mother of one of the students slain at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High will be named to a newly created leadership role in the Broward school district, overseeing improved security measures. The appointment would be effective June 27 and last for six months to one year. Medina told investigators he saw killer Nicolas Cruz arrive and recognized him as a former troubled student but did not confront him or call for a lockdown of the school. Schentrup lost her 16-year-old daughter, Carmen, when Cruz accessed the campus through an unguarded, open gate and shot students and educators with an assault-style rifle. Initially overcome with grief, April Schentrup gradually has emerged as a vocal advocate for school safety and stricter gun laws. she had in her savings account. As director of school safety and security, she will help the district implement new policies and procedures to keep students safe. The South Florida Sun Sentinel has reported extensively on a culture of leniency in the school system that ignores or downgrades misbehavior by students in order to lower arrest rates and keep children out of the juvenile justice system. The district also does not properly report campus crimes and incidents of bullying to the state, giving a rosier picture of student behavior and school safety. Schentrup, 44, is expected to represent the district on outside task forces on school safety and serve as a liaison on safety issues between the public and Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie. As students in Parkland prepare for the end of the school year, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Safety Task Force is working to make sure buildings they return to in the fall are more secure. On Tuesday, Max Schachter of Safe Schools for Alex announced the membership of the task force,... In an interview Friday, Schentrup said Runcie asked her to assist him with the effort and she agreed. Some parents of the victims are running for School Board, but Schentrup said she realized she may be able to achieve change more quickly by working internally. She and her husband, Philip, have said the district violated security protocols on Feb. 14 by having a school gate open 20 minutes before dismissal and not having anyone posted there to monitor who was coming in. Cruz, the 19-year-old gunman, took an Uber to the school and walked through the gate, unchallenged. When students return in August, Stoneman Douglas is slated to be the first school to test the use of metal detectors to screen students and visitors for weapons, Schentrup said."}

NEW: Alleged Townville shooter: 'I know God is real... because the gun jammed' Those desperate efforts were not enough to save the Townville Elementary School first-grader. A year has passed since investigators said a teenager, Jesse Osborne, opened fire on the school playground. The teen is accused of killing his father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne, in their Townville home on Sept. 28, 2016, then taking his truck to the school about three miles away. Investigators say the teen wounded two 6-year-old students, hurt a third student, and shot first-grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth in the shoulder. Jacob died of his injuries three days later. His body was dressed in a Batman costume for his wake, and hundreds of mourners dressed as superheroes in his honor. The tragedy rallied the community in many ways, as people leaned on faith and on one another to try to survive the unimaginable. Now, in Townville, talking about the shooting is akin to digging at a still-open wound.

On April 24, Renae Hall was arrested on charges of possessing cocaine, marijuana and methamphetamine. The drugs were found during a consensual search of her Chevy Equinox, according to arrest warrants. The search occurred at In-Town Suites, an extended-stay hotel on Civic Center Boulevard in Anderson. She was living apart from her husband.

No civil suit had been filed as of Wednesday.

Since the shooting, Anderson District 4 has taken steps to ramp up security at all of its schools, according to Avery. Jesse Osborne was 14 when he was tackled by a firefighter and arrested at the school moments after the shooting last September. The seriousness of the charges against Osborne and his age at the time of the alleged crime are among key factors that a judge will consider when determining whether to waive, or transfer, his case from family court to general sessions, or adult criminal court. Tiffney Osborne, center, mother of Jesse Osborne, the teen charged in the Townville Elementary School shooting, walks in with family before her son's detention hearing in October 2016 at the Anderson County Courthouse. Solicitor David Wagner, who took office in January, said he would do the same. A waiver hearing, the proceeding that will determine the course of Osborne's case, has not yet been held. Because of his age, Osborne's waiver hearing will be held in family court. A family court judge has the authority to, but is not required to, waive to adult court a child of any age who is charged with murder, according to a guide to South Carolina's juvenile justice system. The guide was created by the Children's Law Center at the University of South Carolina School of Law. The U.S. Supreme Court has identified multiple factors that a judge may consider when determining whether to send a child's case to adult criminal court. Other factors a judge may consider are a child's level of maturity and whether he or she has other criminal history. It is exceedingly rare for a case involving a child defendant to be waived up to adult criminal court in South Carolina, Gupta-Kagan said. Statistics from the state Department of Juvenile Justice show that in 2015-16, only three cases involving children were waived up to circuit court. Solicitor Barry Barnette, who works in the 7th Judicial Circuit in neighboring Spartanburg County, prosecuted a murder case from 2011 that involved a teenage defendant. Eric Lankford was 14 when he fatally shot his father, Joe Robert Lankford, his grandmother, Rachel Gaston Lankford and his great-aunt, Virginia Gaston, at their home. Lankford, who had no prior criminal record, called 911 to report the shootings. He told the operator he would turn on the porch light and he came out of the house with his hands in the air when officers arrived, according to the Solicitor's Office. In an interview with investigators, Lankford he said he shot his father first, his great-aunt second and his grandmother third. After his arrest, Lankford underwent multiple mental health evaluations. He was found competent to stand trial, but medical professionals cited conditions that included abnormal brain development and other learning disabilities, according to the Solicitor's Office. In March 2015, Lankford, by then 18, pleaded guilty but mentally ill to three counts of murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. He was sentenced to 40 years in prison. A case involving a juvenile defendant can be a long process, and it can involve several experts and evaluations. Avery said in her statement that school district workers have a goal to support staff, students and families the best way they can. Their content is produced independently from our newsrooms.

Seven people are at Clear Lake Regional Medical in Webster, Texas; two patients are being treated at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City and three patients are at John Sealy University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Aerial video from the scene showed several police officers outside the school. Some were searching students and their backpacks. The witness who spoke to KTRK also said she heard an alarm. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told CNN affiliate KPRC that she heard gunshots only after hearing an alarm in the school. The entire school district is on lockdown, district officials said. The high school has about 1,400 students, according to GreatSchools.org. On Wednesday, an Illinois school resource officer shot and wounded a former student who fired a weapon near a graduation rehearsal at Dixon High School, authorities said. The suspected gunman faces three charges of aggravated discharge of a firearm. On May 11, a 14-year-old boy in In Palmdale, California, went to Highland High, his former school, and began shooting a semiautomatic rifle shortly before classes began, authorities said. He was taken into custody and is accused of attempted murder. One person was wounded. Too many years. Trump said federal authorities are coordinating with local officials.

The incident occurred shortly before students were to walk out as part of a national protest against gun violence. The 17-year-old Forest High School student, who was shot in the ankle, was in good condition at a hospital with a wound not considered life threatening, officials said. A school resource officer, Deputy Jimmy Long, heard a loud bang at 8:39 a.m. and rushed to the scene, Woods told reporters.

As Bouche was being escorted out of the sheriff's headquarters on his way to the county jail, a reporters asked whether he had anything to say. Bouche is charged with terrorism, aggravated assault with a firearm, culpable negligence, carrying a concealed and unlicensed firearm, possessing a firearm on school property, possession of a short-barreled shotgun, interfering with school function and armed trespass on school property. Earlier, an emotional Woods said he did not want students to be afraid in school. ... We as a whole need to do something. 'The hand of God was over our children' Woods and school officials said the resource officer's quick response and active shooter protocols at the school helped save lives. Students at the Ocala, Florida, school used desks, chairs and file cabinets to barricade themselves. Jake Mailhiot, 16, a junior, posted a photo to social media of desks, chairs and other furniture piled high over the door to the classroom where he was studying psychology. The barricade was meant to keep out an active shooter. Mailhiot and other students helped a teacher block the door, he said. They were on lockdown for about an hour. A suspect is in custody after Friday's shooting at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida. Authorities had asked residents to avoid the campus area, which was surrounded by emergency vehicles and buses transporting students away from the scene.

Osborne, a boy who was 14 when he was charged in the shooting death of his father at their home and a first-grader on a South Carolina elementary school playground will be tried as an adult, a judge ruled Friday. They finished watching a video of Jesse Osborne being interviewed in 2016 by investigators. He had been researching other school shooters for months and, determined to outdo them, learned exactly how many people they'd murdered: 13 at Columbine High; 26 at Sandy Hook Elementary; 32 at Virginia Tech. On Valentine's Day, at the same time police say another angry teen, Nikolas Cruz, slaughtered 17 people at a Parkland, Florida, high school with a semiautomatic AR-15, Jesse was sitting in a South Carolina courtroom, waiting to find out if he would be tried as an adult for a 2016 rampage that left his father and a 6-year-old dead. The two teens have much in common. Both, investigators say, tortured animals, obsessed over guns and bragged of their deadly intentions on social media. And in the hours after Cruz's alleged killing spree, as the nation began, once again, to ask why, a group of detectives, prosecutors and psychiatrists were providing answers about Jesse, now 15. He'd detailed his motives in dozens of online messages, in his 46-page confession and in lengthy interviews with doctors who evaluated him, offering extraordinary insight into the mind of an American school shooter. For Peter Langman, one of the country's leading experts on the subject, the teen's calculated approach and lack of empathy called to mind Eric Harris, one of the Columbine killers Jesse idolized. In fact, James Ballenger, a psychiatrist who interviewed Jesse for a total of nine hours, found that the teen reveled in what he'd done. At the five-day hearing that began Feb. 12, prosecutors pushed for Jesse to be tried as an adult because if he remained in the juvenile system, he could only be held until age 21. Jesse's defense team, meanwhile, tried to portray him as a lost but misunderstood child, alleging that he had been bullied by kids at school and mistreated by his father at home. Jesse, who had grown up on his family's chicken farm, liked to shoot guns, but so did many boys his age in Townville, a rural community 40 miles southwest of Greenville. An avid reader of history, he told his family he wanted to fly to space when he grew up. At odds with that portrait were Jesse's own words, captured in dozens of messages he'd exchanged in his private chat group, which the teen claimed included users from around the world. Two days later, he debated whether he should attack his middle school, from which he'd been expelled, or his elementary school, just up the road. He decided on Townville Elementary, because it was closer and had no armed security. The agency declined to comment, citing Jesse's open case. In the chat, he said he had researched police response times for the area and found that it would take them 15 minutes to get there, and maybe 45 for SWAT. He said he would throw pipe bombs into each classroom before he got in a shootout with police and killed himself with his shotgun. He said he had been planning a massacre for two years. Seven hours after he was pinned to the ground outside Townville Elementary by a volunteer firefighter, Jesse acknowledged in an interview with investigators that he'd shot far fewer kids than he'd intended. The problem, he explained, was the weapon. caliber pistol his father kept in a dresser drawer. It had jammed on the playground, just 12 seconds after he first pulled the trigger. The weapon Jesse really wanted, the one he'd tried desperately to get, was, the teenager believed, locked in his father's gun safe: the Ruger Mini-14, a semiautomatic rifle much like the gun that, 17 months later, was fired again and again at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, during one of the deadliest school shootings in American history. The Townville Elementary School was on September 28. Jesse wanted to know what it meant, so he asked his father, who told him about the April 20, 1999, attack that became a seminal moment in the evolution of modern mass shootings. Through much of his childhood, Jesse had seemed no different from any other kid in the Southern community of 4,000 people. Before he attacked Townville Elementary, Jesse had gone there through fifth grade, doing well in his classes and hardly ever getting into trouble. He played catcher on a rec-league baseball team. He got invited to birthday parties. He pulled the legs off crickets and smashed frogs against the ground and habitually watched a video of kittens being mutilated. He also posted Instagram videos about Columbine that some at the school considered a potential threat. The teen grew more volatile, insisting that he'd been bullied, a claim investigators later questioned. After one kid poked his chest, Jesse threatened him. Then, one day, he brought a hatchet and a machete in his backpack. When another student spotted the weapons and reported him, Jesse was expelled and arrested, serving a brief stint in juvenile detention before being placed on probation. It was then, as a home-schooler, that he became consumed with violent fantasies, the court evidence showed. How much his parents knew about them remains unclear, but at least once, the couple came across Internet messages he'd written that they found disturbing, and his mother acknowledged to investigators that he'd become increasingly difficult to raise. Jesse, whose older siblings had moved away, spent long stretches alone in his room, where he played first-person shooter games for hours and scoured the Internet for information on firearms. Beneath one YouTube video reviewing guns, The Washington Post found that he'd asked about the quality of a Hi-Point 9mm Carbine, an affordable semiautomatic rifle. Through that, his fascination with other school shooters, especially Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, bloomed. The pair's influence over the past two decades has been enormous, said Langman. He noted that Jesse was at least the 33rd gunmen to cite Harris and Klebold as an influence. That was clearly true for Jesse, who mentioned Lanza and Harris in his messages and Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech gunman, in his confession. That sounded bizarre for a teenager who knew he would likely face decades in prison, but, as the experts who would analyze him soon discovered, the comment spoke to Jesse's chief motivation. Ballenger, a psychiatrist with 40 years of experience, had already analyzed Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in 2015, and Jared Lee Loughner, who killed six people and wounded Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona in 2011. What he saw in Jesse was a young man who killed not because of bullies or abuse or a fractured mind, but because he wanted to attain the life and status he'd envisioned. Ballenger noted Jesse's Google searches for other mass shootings before his attack. But Jesse didn't kill that many, not even close, and in a country that barely notices school shootings in which just a single child dies, his brief assault garnered only momentary attention outside South Carolina. For Townville, though, those 12 seconds of gunfire were devastating, leaving children, parents and teachers overcome with guilt and post-traumatic stress, as detailed in a Post story last year. A teacher and a student survived their bullet wounds, but one round Jesse is accused of firing took the life of Jacob Hall, a bespectacled 6-year-old who was the smallest child in first grade. Hundreds attended his funeral, where his body laid inside a miniature gray casket topped with a Ninja Turtles figurine. He was dressed in a Batman costume. Jesse showed almost no remorse, according to experts who analyzed him. In court, prosecutors presented evidence that Jesse's preoccupation with violence never receded. After a 15-year-old killed two students and injured at least a dozen other people at a Kentucky school on Jan. 23, Jesse looked up the incident on a computer at the detention center. That's apparently not what Jesse had wanted to convey, though. After his arrest, he'd researched the symptoms of autism and schizophrenia, and in interviews with doctors, he talked of hallucinations that included seeing blue people and the cartoon character Scooby-Doo. His evaluators testified that, without question, he was lying. Ballenger concluded that Jesse was at high risk for developing antisocial personality disorder, often called sociopathy, which cannot be diagnosed before age 18. He recommended that the teen be tried as an adult, and the judge agreed when he issued his Feb. 16 ruling. Never far from the courtroom discussion was the horror of what might have happened if the pistol he'd taken from his father's dresser drawer hadn't jammed or, even worse, he had used the semiautomatic rifle. Once, Jesse had pretended that he was texting on his phone as he tried to film his father typing in the code to the gun safe. Another time, he'd put dish soap on the buttons, hoping it would reveal fingerprints. Jesse could have killed so many more children, he knew, with that Mini-14. But he was wrong. Soon after the shooting, investigators searched the teen's home for evidence. In his parents' bedroom, they looked in the closet, and there, outside the safe and just feet from his father's dresser, was the weapon Jesse coveted.

As we reported in September, 6-year-old Jacob Hall was killed after a gunman opened fire at an Upstate elementary school. Jacob's family has been working with state lawmakers on legislation that would ensure teachers can help keep children safe from a possible attack. A new bill would give educators permission to carry a gun to school. The family began speaking out on installing more resource officers in schools back in October. Now, some Upstate lawmakers say these bills are the answer and the compromise to those wishes. The Townville Elementary School shooting killed Jacob and injured another student and a teacher when the shooter opened fire on the playground. RELATED: See photos from the Townville Elementary School shooting. Bills allowing schools to start a program of having employees or teachers train with state police, and carry a firearm concealed, on their person, when not responding to a live shooter, is the answer for now. The representative who filed the House bill says he was inspired to write this one because one of the first responders to the Townville shooting scene was a firefighter with a CWP. Meanwhile, a similar bill was filed in the Senate, but Sen. Kevin Bryant isn't giving up on resource officers. He plans to introduce a bill for senators to debate how to pay for the officers.

Former JROTC cadets told The Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the small varsity marksmanship team that trained together after class and traveled to other area schools to compete. ANALYSIS: Florida shooting survivors are angry, and they want you to know it The JROTC marksmanship program used air rifles special-made for target shooting, typically on indoor ranges at targets the size of a small coin. Student Colton Haab told CNN that he led more than 60 students into a JROTC room on campus and barricaded them behind Kevlar sheets used by the rifle program in the event the shooter came after them. In the end, they were not targeted by Cruz. Authorities say Cruz, who was expelled from Stoneman Douglas last year for disciplinary reasons, walked into his former school with an AR-15 military-style carbine and opened fire. He is charged with 17 counts of murder. WATCH: FBI admits it did not follow-up on tip against suspected Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz A spokeswoman for the NRA declined to comment on Friday.

He said investigators believe the suspect acted alone, though he didn't release the boy's name or the names of the victims, who were taken to hospitals in Indianapolis. Indiana University Health spokeswoman Danielle Sirilla said the teacher was taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital and the wounded student was taken to Riley Hospital for Children. She didn't know the seriousness of their injuries. After the attack, students were bused to the Noblesville High School gym, where their families could retrieve them. Erica Higgins, who was among the worried parents who rushed to get their kids, told WTHR-TV that she learned of the shooting from a relative who called her at home. Higgins said her son was shaken up but knew little about what happened. Gov. Eric Holcomb, who was returning from a trip to Europe on Friday, issued a statement saying he and other state leaders were getting updates about the situation and that 100 state police officers had been made available to work with local law enforcement.

The attack comes a week after an attack at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed eight students and two teachers, and months after the school attack that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. The Florida attack inspired students from that school and others throughout the country to call for more restrictions on access to guns.

Middle and high school students in the district will be off on Mondays and go to school from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Tuesdays through Fridays. By getting rid of the fifth day, the district will save money on transportation and utility costs. Other districts in the state already have four-day school weeks, but none this large. School District 27J -- which serves 18,000 students in Brighton, Commerce City, Henderson, Thornton and Aurora -- is the 16th largest district in the state. The experiment begins at 8:30 a.m. Friday for middle and high school students. Elementary school children head back to school on Tuesday.

Local law enforcement radio transmissions reveal what was happening as first responders arrived to the scene of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland. Scott TravisContact ReporterSouth Florida Sun Sentinel Privacy Policy Marjory Stoneman Douglas High has fences, gates and emergency procedures to keep students safe, but a determined gunman found a way around them. He came when he knew the gates would be open and set off a fire alarm that would dismantle a safety system, officials say. And the school resource officer, who is supposed to help protect students, may not have been on school grounds at the time. Accused gunman Nikolas Cruz, who had been expelled from the school for behavioral problems, arrived on campus about 20 minutes before the school day ended. Once a person gets onto campus, they have access to a number of classroom buildings, which are often unlocked so that students can easily get to their classes. As a young middle-school student, school shooter Nikolas Cruz regularly got in trouble for using foul language, insulting people, disobeying teachers and disrupting classes. Once the shooting began, the school went into a procedure known as Code Red, where doors are locked and students and staff are required to stay in their classrooms. But Cruz pulled the fire alarm, which created confusion about what procedures to follow, said Lisa Maxwell, executive director of the Broward Principals and Assistants Association. As a result, doors that would have otherwise remained shut were being opened by students, making it easier for the gunman to find victims, experts say. He said there have been numerous problems with kids pulling false alarms as pranks. There are systems available that will give the office 40 seconds to determine whether an emergency is real before sounding a school-wide alarm, Graziose said. The system could also be overhauled so that fire alarm levers are installed only in rooms where large numbers of people gather, such as auditoriums and libraries, rather than in every hallway.

Neither BSO nor school district officials responded to requests for comment Thursday about where the officer was at the time. On Friday, Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said he was told by BSO officials that an officer was at the school but on a different part of campus. The massacre at Stoneman Douglas, the largest school shooting since Sandy Hook in 2012, is prompting other school districts to review their security plans. He said the district has temporarily suspended all emergency drills, to avoid making kids feeling anxious. He came when he knew the gates would be open and set off a fire alarm that would dismantle a safety system, officials say."}

A report released Monday by a school safety task force commissioned by the Broward League of Cities finds at least 100 areas in need of improvement. Scott TravisContact ReporterSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Metal detectors will be at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High this fall, and a new schools safety report recommends adding them at all Broward County schools. The recommendation is one of 100 ways to help keep students alive outlined by a task force created in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas massacre. Recommendations for physical security changes include installing higher fences and considering bullet-resistant glass. The district sent a letter to Stoneman Douglas parents Friday saying that the district will start using portable metal detectors at the Parkland school this fall. Originally planned to start shortly after Spring Break, district officials said they needed more time to figure out logistical issues of how many gates would be open and how to avoid having lines that snake outside at the start of the school day. Document Read the full report of safety recommendations. The report said the district should come up with procedures to check students, while showing respect for their privacy and personal belongings. Conducting random searches with wands could raise concerns about effectiveness and fairness, the report says. The task force, commissioned by the League of Cities, included Sunrise Mayor Mike Ryan, Broward County Mayor Beam Furr, School Board member Patti Good and April Schentrup and Schachter, who both lost children in the massacre. The task force met 10 times and came up with its initial list of recommendations in time for the school district and other government agencies to include proposals in the upcoming budget year. Some recommendations may be refined as new information comes out from other investigations, Ryan said. The committee plans to lobby the state for more money. Good said the school district has received the report and the School Board is considering a joint meeting with the task force to discuss what can be done. They were students, they were teachers. Athletes, dancers, coaches, musicians. The 17 who were lost in the senseless shooting on February 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, leave behind heartbroken family, friends, classmates and communities. These are their faces... Among the other recommendations: -- The district should install window coverings on doors to conceal kids in schools. -- The height of outdoor fences should be increased. -- More mental health counselors, psychologist and social workers are needed who can focus on students well-being instead of on testing. Better marketing of mental health services is also recommended. -- The county needs to find a better way to pay for school resource officers. Cities decide how many officers to pay for, which has left 35 schools without any police officers. The plans should be delivered to municipal law enforcement who should acknowledge the review. -- All classroom doors must remain locked at all times (the current doors only lock from the hallway, not from inside of classroom). -- Within the first two weeks of school, schools should practice a lockdown drill with school resource officer participation, in addition to fire and tornado drills, and a Code Red (critical incident) drill every semester. -- All staff and students should wear ID badges, something that is already district policy but irregularly enforced. -- School administrators need to do ensure they are enforcing discipline rules appropriately. Questions have arisen about whether the shooter at Stoneman Douglas was appropriately disciplined for various infractions. The district has already announced plans to start reviewing discipline enforcement as part of regular school audits. The program, which stands for Preventing Recidivism Through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support and Education, was created in 2013 to provide alternatives to arrests. The district has claimed a nearly 90 percent success rate, but the South Florida Sun Sentinel discovered that students are not considered repeat offenders unless they commit the exact same offense in the exact same year. The school district has agreed to discuss sharing information at a June 19 meeting. -- School staff must supervise all open entrances during school starting and closing times. Many portable classrooms have no intercom systems. -- After school, sports or summer activities must have a security plan in place, with safety responsibilities assigned to a specific trained staff member. -- All public areas should be monitored by cameras. -- Schools should have a buzzer system to better control access to visitors.

A shooting at Carver High School on Friday left one student with non-life-threatening injuries and another student in custody. Authorities put the school on lockdown after the incident. According to eyewitness accounts and police, the shooting happened outside of the school building at the end of a scheduled fire drill. Officer Tim Wilson, a school resource officer assigned to the high school, called in the report of the shooting, Winston-Salem Police Chief Barry Rountree said at a news conference after the shooting. Christopher Lamont Richardson, 18, whom authorities say lives on La Deara Crest Lane, later was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, inflicting serious injury; carrying a concealed gun; possessing and discharging a firearm, and carrying a firearm onto educational property, arrest warrants say. Wilson, a 25-year police veteran, saw the shooting and arrested the suspect without incident, Rountree said. The victim was identified as Antwain Deshaun Porter, 15. He was being treated Friday night at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, where he was in stable condition, police said. Porter was shot with a .38 caliber handgun, according to an arrest warrant. A witness said four or five shots were fired. He is scheduled to appear in court Sept. 26. Investigators are trying to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting, Rountree said. The shooting was a result of on-going dispute between Richardson and Porter, police said in a statement later Friday. The shots were fired as students were going back into the school after the fire drill, police said. Before the shooting, Wilson was helping students return to the classes. Schools Superintendent Beverly Emory praised Wilson for his quick action in arresting the suspect and protecting other students. He also praised police officers and school officials for their quick actions to protect students and the public. A contingent of 30 to 60 police officers responded to the scene, police Lt. Jeff Watson said. Officers delayed traffic in front of Carver High School. Police set up an area at nearby Russell Community Center where parents could pick up their children. Authorities allowed school buses one at a time to pick up riders, so police could account for every student, Watson said. School officials released the students to their parents or buses at about 4:15 p.m. Students were patted down before getting on buses. School officials postponed the Carver home football game Friday night against Reynolds High School, Emory said. The game will be rescheduled, she said. The school district will have a crisis team at the school when classes resume Tuesday to help students, their parents and staff members cope with the shooting. School officials notified parents of Carver students Friday about the incident and informed them that the victim had non-life-threatening injuries, Emory said. Despite the shooting, Carver is a safe school, and district administrators work with local law-enforcement agencies to make sure every school in the district is safe, Emory said. In the wake of the shooting, school officials will discuss with experts the possibility of installing metal detectors at Carver and other schools, Emory said. Since the Columbine shooting in 1999, school districts have used metal detectors, she said. Emory also questioned how any school could screen several hundred students with a metal detector each morning before classes begin. A fight between two juveniles had occurred earlier in the day at Carver. caliber pistol in a book bag inside a classroom, authorities said. The student who brought the weapon to school was charged with possession of a weapon on school property. Raul Olivera Mejia, 22, who lives on Efrid Street, pleaded guilty in Forsyth District Court in March to a misdemeanor charge of failure to secure a weapon to protect a minor, according to court records. A judge issued a prayer for judgment, which means no punishment was imposed. Emory said school officials believe the last school shooting in the school district occurred in the late 1960s. On May 13, 1969, Ernest Napoleon Carter Jr., 13, was shot and killed at Hanes Junior High School by a 13-year-old classmate, authorities said at the time. Reginald T. Goldsmith was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the shooting. Sign up for our daily morning newsletter. getRecommendations. audiences or keywords to work with."}

The shooting happened on Friday just before 3:30 p.m. at the Delaware Valley Charter School at 5201 Old York Road in the Olney section of the city, Philadelphia Police say. A teen boy, who attends the school, pulled out a handgun inside the school's gymnasium and then the weapon fired, according to officials. An 18-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy were injured in the shooting, which took place near the gymnasium, police said. The bullet struck the rear of the girl's left arm, exited her bicep and then struck the boy in the shoulder, according to police. Both victims were rushed to Albert Einstein Medical Center, which is just a block north of the high school. The girl was discharged from the hospital around 6 p.m., but the boy remains hospitalized. He is currently in stable condition. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey says there were seven students inside the gym when the shooting happened and that the entire incident was caught on surveillance video. Guns in Charter Schools Challenge Perception of Safety THE SUSPECTS At the height of the investigation immediately following the shooting, Philadelphia Police used surveillance video to identify alleged suspects. Police also say they received information from school security and school officials. Based on that information, police say they identified a 15-year-old student from South Philadelphia as a suspect. Police descended on the home of the student and brought him in for questioning. Officials said they thought he was either the shooter or was with the shooter. But hours later, that teen was released and, police say, will not be charged. According to police, the boy was not involved in the shooting. They also claim the security officials provided inaccurate information regarding the boy. The school did not address the police allegations of inaccurate information in its statement. That same family member, an uncle who wished to remain anonymous, said his nephew's involvement in the shooting was some kind of mistake. After examining the surveillance video and conducting numerous interviews, police identified two suspects in the shooting. A 16-year-old boy was taken into custody and questioned at Philadelphia Police's Northwest Detective Division. Investigators initially said they considered him a co-conspirator, but did not believe he was the shooter. He was questioned and then released Saturday morning. He has not been charged. Police filed charges against a second suspect, a 17-year-old boy. The teen turned himself in on Saturday and is charged with two counts of aggravated assault and other related offenses. SEPTA Police searched trash cans and station concourses to see if the gun used was dumped. So far, those searches have been futile.

The school serves more than 600 students in grades 9 through 12. The school was placed on lockdown following the shooting and was quickly secured. Officials say students were searched and then released on a one-by-one basis. The school was completely cleared at 5:30 p.m. Parents told NBC10 reporters on the scene that there have been several fights at the school recently and that they had concerns about safety. Police say the school does have security. The building is also equipped with metal detectors, so investigators are trying to figure out how the student was able to get the gun into the school. from loading. All rights reserved."}

The suspect is accused of shooting his father to death and opening fire on Townville Elementary School students when he was 14-years-old. The teenager, and accused shooter, has been charged with 2 counts of murder, 3 counts of attempted murder and 5 counts of a weapons charge after investigators said he fatally shot his father before driving to Townville Elementary School's playground and opening fire, killing one student. The victims were identified by the coroner as 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne and 6-year-old Jacob Hall. The Solicitor's Office filed a motion back in October of 2016 to have the suspect tried as an adult in the case. Due to his age, the teen would not be eligible for the death penalty, but could face a sentence of up to life in prison. On Thursday, during day 4 of testimony in the hearing, Dr. James Ballenger - who also diagnosed convicted Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof - spoke out on his experience speaking with and interviewing the accused Townville shooter. SLIDESHOW: Hearing underway in deadly Townville school shooting case Ballenger said the teen displayed no signs of psychiatric disorder, and said in court that the accused shooter appeared to be developmentally above average. Ballenger said the accused shooter showed no signs of Schizophrenia, but did exhibit high risk conduct disorder, and noted that there was nothing wrong with the accused shooter other than mild depression. In court, Ballenger said the accused shooter talked about the abuse of animals and his love for shooting them with BB guns. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Townville school shooting headlines Ballenger said the accused shooter exhibited a lack of remorse for the shooting, even laughing and smiling when victim Jacob Hall's autopsy was shown. According to Ballenger, the accused shooter had an emotional breakdown after shooting his father. Ballenger went on to say the accused shooter talked about how shooting people was fun and even said he did the 6-year-old victim a favor by shooting him.

Osborne was arrested at the age of 14 after investigators said he opened fire on the elementary school playground, striking 6-year-old Jacob Hall. Jacob passed away three days after the shooting. He is also charged with murder in the fatal shooting of his father, Jeffrey Osborne, just hours prior to his suspected attack on the school on Sep. 28, 2016. In a five-day hearing to determine how Osborne should be tried, state prosecutors called nearly 20 witnesses who testified on his past, mental health, internet activity and more. A 46-page transcript was released of when investigators said Osborne confessed while detained after the shooting. The defense argued the confession should be inadmissible since Osborne was questioned without a parent or lawyer present. A judge, however, ruled the confession was voluntary and would be allowed. READ MORE: Court releases 46-page transcript of Townville shooting suspect's confession The confession transcript states that Osborne told authorities he was angry after being bullied. He also said after shooting his father and before driving to Townville Elementary, he kissed his pet rabbit and three dogs goodbye, the document states. FBI Special Agent Shandal Ewing testified that messages from an Instagram account created by Osborne detailed plans to attack the school days before the shooting.

The state presented evidence recovered from Osborne's phone depicting images of these shooters along with memes making light of mass shootings. An Anderson County digital forensics investigator testified that Osborne had searched the internet for graphic websites and video depicting torture. Following his arrest, a Greenville County Schools teacher who instructs at the juvenile detention center said Osborne listened to a rap song more than 50 times on his computer containing graphic lyrics including a threat to shoot up a town.

READ MORE: Psychiatrist in court: Townville school shooting suspect displayed no signs of psychiatric disorder, should be tried as adult The state called forward witnesses including a psychologist who testified that Osborne told them he had been physically and verbally abused by his father and by bullies. Dr. Ernest Martin said Osborne showed signs of mild depression with psychotic features and post-traumatic stress disorder. A minister also testified that Osborne had been kind and thoughtful in their interactions and said Osborne had asked for prayers to get the help he needed. The testimony, however, did not convince a judge that Osborne should be tried under juvenile status. Due to his age, Osborne is not eligible for the death penalty if convicted, but he could face up to life in prison. He is charged with two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder.

Sawed-off shotguns are illegal without a permit from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The .38-caliber handgun was purchased in the early 1990s, the official said. Investigators have identified the original buyers, but how Dimitrios ultimately obtained the weapons is still under investigation, the official said. He said he ate and played with his son the night before the shooting, and Dimitrios left early the next morning. Officers exchanged gunfire with Dimitrios before a 25-minute negotiation ended in his surrender. The suspect and officers did not exchange gunfire during the negotiation, the sheriff said. Dimitrios told an investigator he acted alone and spared people he liked because he wanted his story told, according to a probable cause affidavit. The massacre claimed the lives of students Sabika Sheikh, Shana Fisher, Jared Black, Chris Stone, Angelique Ramirez, Christian Riley Garcia, Aaron Kyle McLeod and Kimberly Vaughan. Teachers Glenda Ann Perkins and Cynthia Tisdale were also killed. Houston police Officer John Barnes, a resource officer at the school who confronted the gunman, was among the victims hospitalized. Barnes was in intensive care following surgery Monday, said Walter Braun, police chief of the Santa Fe Independent School District. Under Texas law, offenders younger than 18 who are charged with a capital offense face a maximum penalty of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years. Gov. Abbott on Tuesday kicked off the first of three roundtable discussions on school security, gun safety and the accounts of victims, including those from Santa Fe. The first roundtable, which focused on school and community safety, included almost two dozen school administrators, politicians, law enforcement officials and an architect with expertise on school design, among others. On Wednesday, district teachers and support staff will return to school, the district said. All students will return May 29, the district said.

As the shooting unfolded Wednesday afternoon behind Townville Elementary School, the teenager, who was not identified because of his age, was taken to the ground by a volunteer firefighter and taken into custody by deputies, authorities said. The father of the suspected shooter was found dead after being shot, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore told reporters. Shore identified him as Jeffrey Osborne, 47, who was found at a house about 2 miles from the school. The teenager called his grandmother at 1:44 p.m. ET, sobbing and speaking unintelligibly, Shore said at a second news conference. The grandparents went to the boy's house next door to check on the father and the boy. The couple found the father but not the boy. Read More About 1:45 p.m., a teacher at the school called 911 to report a shooting. One male student was critically injured with a gunshot to the leg and another boy was struck in a foot. A female teacher was wounded in a shoulder, sheriff's Capt. Garland Major said. It is unclear whether the alleged shooter knew any of the school victims. Major said the motive is unclear, but terrorism has been ruled out. CNN has not determined whether the boy has an attorney. Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said the boy started firing after getting out of his vehicle in the parking lot near the playground. Witnesses told police it appeared the boy was headed toward the school. Several teachers locked doors to prevent him from getting in. School nurses and emergency responders saved the life of the boy who was shot in the leg, said Scott Stoller, the director of EMS in Anderson County. The firefighter, Jamie Brock, declined to meet with the media, but Stoller said the man said he did nothing any other firefighter wouldn't have done. The teacher and one student taken to AnMed Health Center were released Wednesday evening, hospital spokesman Ross Norton told CNN. The other child was taken to Greenville Health System emergency trauma center by helicopter, spokeswoman Sandy Dees said. Dees told CNN on Wednesday night that student was in critical condition. The mother of a student at Townville Elementary School told CNN Greenville affiliate WYFF that her daughter and classmates huddled in a bathroom. I know all the kids were scared. ... I'm just so scared. The mother said she was praying for the families of the injured. The shooting occurred about 1:45 p.m. ET, officials said. Townville is in the extreme western part of the state, southwest of Greenville and near the Georgia line. Anderson County has a population of about 194,692. The elementary school has about 280 students. About 30 school employees are listed on the school's website. School has been canceled for the rest of the week. Joanne Avery, superintendent of Anderson County School District 4, told the media that school personnel have participated in active-shooter training and she said that training kept the incident from being much worse. Gov. Nikki Haley said she would make sure law enforcement would have the resources it needed as investigators do their work.

Meanwhile, KHOU in Houston, which is near Santa Fe, reports that at least one student has been taken to the hospital via Life Flight. Life Flight has responded to a school in Santa Fe where there are reports of a shooter at the high school. The school is located at 16000 Highway 6, about 30 miles southeast of Houston. KHOU also reports that some students say they were evacuated down the street. Other reports, these unconfirmed, say describe an exchange of gunfire between police and the suspect. BREAKING: ATF is responding to a school shooting at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas. Santa Fe High School is on lockdown after a situation with an active shooter on campus. Witnesses say the shooting took place in an art class on campus between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. This is an unconfirmed report. Sophomore Leila Butler tells ABC13 that at about 7:45 a.m. fire alarms went off and students left their classrooms. She is currently sheltering with other students and teachers near campus. However, we should caution everyone to remember that initial news reports are often very wrong. This could be nothing to speak of or it could be something horrific. What we do know is that we will continue to monitor this situation as it develops. Check back here for more news. 10:21 EST Edit: Click2Houston is reporting that there may well be a fatality at the scene and that more than one student was taking out via Life Flight. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured, but video from Sky2 showed a white sheet draped over something in front of a door to the school. One student said that he heard as many as eight gunshots. Another student reported hearing several gunshots before hearing alarms and being told to evacuate. Parents were gathering at a nearby Chevron gas station to connect with their children. Santa Fe ISD officials said in a statement that students are being taken to the Alamo Gym at 13306 Highway 6 where they will be reunited with their parents. Sky2 video also showed at least two Life Flight helicopters at the school. Dozens of students could be seen standing in lines and emptying their backpacks. They also report that police have someone in custody. More as it develops. 10:48 EST Edit: CBS News has updated their story to report an eyewitness account of the shooting. When teachers and students were outside, shots were fired. Tyler ran behind some trees, heard more shots, jumped a fence and ran to a car wash. He said he saw firefighters treat a girl who had a bandage around her knee and may have been shot. This, coupled with what have been reported as two Life Flights makes one wonder how many were transported via conventional ambulance for less life-threatening wounds. There has still been no official word about fatalities. 11:15 EST Edit: CNN also reports that a suspect is in custody. Additionally, a second person is being detained by authorities. The reason for that is currently unknown. An armed person walked into an art class at the school and began firing what looked like a shotgun, a witness told CNN affiliate KTRK. The witness told KTRK she saw a girl shot in the leg. Patients from the school are being taken to a hospital in the nearby city of Galveston, hospital spokesman Raul Reyes said. He did not say how many or give details about the injuries. At least one police officer was injured, Sheriff Gonzalez said. Not yet. 11:36 EST Edit: CNN is now reporting at least eight people were killed at the Santa Fe High School shooting earlier today. However, at this point, it seems extremely likely that there were a number of fatalities at the school. Click2Houston says that authorities are still trying to determine if there was more than one shooter or not, or whether the suspect they have in custody acted alone. 2:16 EST Edit: NBC News is reporting through their headline that ten people have been killed. Nine students and one teacher were killed in the shooting at Santa Fe High School, according to several law enforcement sources who cautioned that the number could change. It also appears the shooter had three different firearms on him. A shotgun, a modern sporting rifle, and a handgun. 3:51 EST Edit: The New York Times is reporting that the shooter used a shotgun and a revolver. The suspect was identified as 17-year-old Dimitrios Pagourtzis, according to a law enforcement official. He used a shotgun and a .38 revolver, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said at a news conference. What we are hearing a fair bit is the use of a shotgun as at least a primary weapon in the attack. He lives with his family in Southwest Georgia. Media. All Rights Reserved."}

Federal law enforcement officials identified one of them as Dimitrios Pagourtzis, and said he is suspected of having fired the shots. Pagourtzis used a shotgun and a revolver that were legally owned by his father, Abbott said. Gunfire erupted at the school, about 20 miles outside Galveston, not long after classes began around 7:30 a.m. CT, officials said. Authorities later found explosive devices -- including pipe bombs and pressure cookers -- in and near the school, the law enforcement official said. A male suspect, believed to be a student, has been arrested in the shooting, and a second person -- also believed to be a student -- has been detained as well, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. The male that Gonzalez described as a suspect is injured, a law enforcement official said on condition of anonymity. Investigators believe that the second person, an 18-year-old, may be an accomplice but not a shooter, a law enforcement official said. Two law enforcement officers are among the injured, according to a law enforcement source. One man is in critical condition with a gunshot wound in one of his arms, said David Marshall, chief nursing officer for University of Texas Medical Branch hospital. This is the 22nd US school shooting since the beginning of the year, and the third instance in eight days in which a gunman was on a school campus. Witnesses described students running from the school as they heard gunshots; they also described hearing an alarm at the school, though the sequence of events wasn't immediately clear. Authorities found explosive devices in the high school and in adjacent areas, said Walter Braun, Santa Fe Independent School District police chief. It wasn't immediately clear if any had exploded. Investigators Friday afternoon were searching a trailer where they believe the devices were assembled, a law enforcement source said. The school has been cleared of all students and staff, who have been directed to a nearby facility to reunite with their families, Braun said. Witness: Shooter fired gun in an art class An armed person walked into an art class at the school and began firing what looked like a shotgun, a witness told CNN affiliate KTRK. The witness told KTRK she saw a girl shot in the leg. At least 13 people from the school were being treated at three hospitals, authorities said. Eight people were at Clear Lake Regional Medical in Webster, Texas; two patients were being treated at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City; and three patients are at John Sealy University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Six of the eight patients at Clare Lake Regional were discharged by Friday afternoon. Aerial video from the scene showed several police officers outside the school. Some were searching students and their backpacks. The witness who spoke to KTRK also said she heard an alarm. She didn't specify if that was before or after the gunfire she described in the art class. She said she couldn't describe the shooter. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told CNN affiliate KPRC that she heard gunshots only after hearing an alarm in the school. MaKenna Evans, a 16-year-old sophomore, told CNN she was in geometry class when the shooting started. First, she heard a fire alarm, she said. When the students got outside, her principal told them all to run. Evans said students hid behind a building across the street from the school. The high school has about 1,400 students, according to GreatSchools.org. Three gun incidents in eight days Friday's shooting was the third time someone with a gun was reported on a US school in recent days. On Wednesday, an Illinois school resource officer shot and wounded a former student who fired a weapon near a graduation rehearsal at Dixon High School, authorities said. The suspected gunman faces three charges of aggravated discharge of a firearm. On May 11, a 14-year-old boy in In Palmdale, California, went to Highland High, his former school, and began shooting a semiautomatic rifle shortly before classes began, authorities said.

The goal, according to Stanley, is not to save money but to recruit more educators. In order for students to be in school for 1,080 hours during the academic year as required by law, Stanley said the plan moving forward is to close schools across the district on Fridays but add 40 minutes to each school day Monday through Thursday. Holiday breaks will also be slightly shorter, scheduled professional days would be moved to Fridays when school is out and snow days could also be made up on Fridays. One parent we spoke with said she doesn't think this is a big change but, rather, a better change. Parents like Jeannene Williams said though she's excited to spend more time with her children, she's on the fence with the new plan. The other issue schools had to consider were childcare and if meals would served on Fridays when school will be out. According to Stanley, 76 percent of students in McLoud schools qualify for free and reduced meals. We also are meeting this week with a company that will come in and offer daycare using our facility. Stanley said they will try this new school schedule out for the next year. In that year, they will look at a number of factors including test scores, attendance, discipline and the quality of teachers they are hiring.

Another student killed, Jared Black, turned 17 last week and was supposed to have a birthday party Saturday. The massacre also claimed the lives of students Sabika Sheikh, a Pakistani exchange student; Chris Stone; Angelique Ramirez; Christian Riley Garcia; Aaron Kyle McLeod; and Kimberly Vaughan. Teachers Glenda Ann Perkins and Cynthia Tisdale were also killed. The people hospitalized included retired Houston police Officer John Barnes, who served as a resource officer at the school and confronted the gunman. He was armed with a shotgun and a .38 caliber handgun, both legally owned by his father, according to Gov. Greg Abbott. Pagourtzis is being held without bail and is accused of capital murder of multiple people and aggravated assault on a public servant. He has not entered a plea. Attorneys Robert Barfield and Nicholas Poehl said they had met with Pagourtzis for two 30-minute visits. Under Texas law, offenders who are under age 18 and charged with a capital offense face a maximum punishment of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years. Instead, he put the blame on issues such as abortion, violent video games and the lack of armed teachers. He also made a connection between violent video games and abortions. We have families that are broken apart, no fathers at home. The lieutenant governor also said more armed teachers would help avert school massacres.

St. Joseph was the first private school in Anderson County to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Our students score very well on national standardized tests, with many of the 4th through 8th graders qualifying for Duke TIP. Staffed by certified teachers, our school offers small class sizes, personalized attention, and a family-friendly atmosphere. These factors combine to contribute greatly to the success of our students.St. Joseph Catholic School focuses on enabling children to reach their full potential, both academically and spiritually. The students are taught love and respect for self and others, compassion and responsibility, dignity and integrity, peace and justice. This integration of values and academics enables each student to grow as a whole person.Many special subject classes are offered, including; Spanish, music, band, art, physical education and computer. The school also offers several after-school activities including drama club, Lego League, and art club to name a few. The PTO is very active and bridges the gap between home and school with many family-oriented activities. Joseph Catholic School also viewed these schools: Montessori School Of Anderson and New Covenant School. Joseph Catholic School in the 1st grade and now in the 5th grade. However, she went to public school for the 3rd grade and she and I felt that she should have learned more that year. What was taught to her in 3rd grade public school is a lot of what was taught to her in 2nd grade at St. Joseph's. I like how St Joseph's pushes the children harder and has them well prepared for the next year. Religion is taught to them almost every day and Mass is part of our weekly schedule. We are not a catholic family and we like how nobody sees us any differently. My favorite things about St. Joseph's is how small the classes are, how the teachers can work one on one with the children and how we are all one big happy family. This school's success is attributable to the outstanding teaching staff who foster a positive and caring learning environment. One of my child's teachers went above and beyond to help him. We were blessed to have someone so loving and dedicated to her job. The class sizes are smaller compared to other schools, which is just what my child needed. It is truly a wonderful school with loving,dedicated teachers and strong academics. We pray before every class and all the teachers integrate the Catholic Faith into every lesson. The values of faith and knowledge are seen in the actions of all the children; all of the children are respectful and helpful to the teachers and other children. As a teacher, I am privileged to know my middle school students, but I also know the younger children. I know almost all of the students by name. St. Joseph is academically excellent; the curriculum goes beyond the state standards. St. Joseph is a blessed place where challenging academics and a strong faith-filled environment are seen everyday. They range for 20 years of age to 8 years of age. As a parent of international heritage I am able to compare and contrast various international school curriculum and after school activities and what they bring to the table for elementary, middle and high school. I have working knowledge of 5 high schools in Upstate - public and private including the SC Governors School at Hartsville as my oldest St. Joseph's child was able to successfully navigate in flying colors there and has transitioned into one of the top 10 US colleges. I can safely say do not hesitate to spend the dollars to put your child in this school. This effort will save you a lot of heart ache in later years as the child not only academically achieves but also grows up to be a responsible adult due to the structural foundation laid in this school. Here are further details. Their most recent upgrade of the curriculum - All subjects to meet international curriculum from the University of Notre Dame (Notre Dame selected this tiny school among 35 others nationally to upgrade their curriculum) is a solid reason to keep or move your child from other public schools, if possible, to this private school. Their sciences meet the NGSS otherwise called the Next Generation Science Standards. Their math meets the the International standards and not US standards. The teachers are here dedicated to help parents and students academically which is set to internationally standards. The principal is always ready to introduce concepts that will increase student body overall achievement. Their drama, orchestra, band and robotics team (started last year and they have qualified for state for 2 teams this year and the first middle team qualified both years)have done well. Please talk to the school and the principal will be happy to share further details in these areas. It takes a community to raise a child. You want this St. Joseph's community on your side as you raise your child. As a non-catholic I am more than pleased with the spirit, dedication and knowledge this team of dedicated teachers brings toward the personal, academic and overall growth of your child. There is NO difference except for the fact that this school is a hidden gem in the tiny town of Anderson and fairly unknown. The elementary and middle school years are the most important. Once the study habits, discipline and now the international knowledge base has been inculcated into your child - high school will be a breeze- both for you and your child. I can safely say do not hesitate to put your child in this well rounded school. The teachers put an emphasis on the whole child - both academically and spiritually. We have enjoyed being a member of the St. Joseph family. Joseph Pre-K program it is a wonderful small facility with a great academic structure. Both of my sons attended St. Joes. The small class size and individual attention has helped my sons blossom. The school has a strong academic curriculum - my kids were academically challenged, but in a positive and loving environment. I can't say enough good things about the teachers and quality education my kids have received. In fact, my youngest will be attending their new middle school (they just added it two years ago) next year. St. Joseph provides an excellent academic foundation for children in PK through middle school. The teachers are well-quaified and extremely dedicated. The atmosphere is loving and respectful. Class sizes are small, allowing for individual attention. Music, art, physical education, band, library, Spanish and computer are offered on a weeky basis.

The suspect, whose name has not been released, was accused by police of fatally shooting his 47-year-old father, Jeffrey DeWitt Osborne, then driving a pickup truck about 2 miles (3.2 km) to Townville Elementary School where he crashed into a fence surrounding the playground.

The shooter never entered the building, said Chief Deputy Keith Smith. Authorities do not know the motivation of the shooting but ruled out race as both the shooter and victims were white. U.S. schools have taken added security precautions since 2012 when a gunman shot and killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. WATCH: South Carolina police believe body found linked to school shooting Brock, a 30-year veteran of the Townville Volunteer Fire Department, was hailed on social media as a hero and credited with preventing another school massacre. One of the victims, 6-year-old Jacob Hall who police say was shot in the leg, remained in critical condition, Greenville Health System spokeswoman Sandy Dees said. The boy, who local media reported was 6 years old, was shot in the foot and the teacher in the shoulder, authorities said.

The measure was added to state law in light of recent school shootings where armed attackers tripped fire alarms to lure students out of classrooms, making them easy targets. Nineva-Hensley-Jackson Schools Superintendent, Dr. Tim Edsell says his district already has plans to adopt the evacuation option into their safety plan. The evacuation delay option is just the latest safety discussion to address fire alarms in schools. Earlier this year, talk was brewing on social media about getting rid of fire alarm pull stations inside schools. A position statement by the Indiana Fire Chiefs Association said fire chiefs around the state were being asked how to officially and safely remove pull-stations in a school building. Those conversations prompted a message of caution from some fire officials. The law addressing fire evacuation delays leaves room for schools to adopt locally-specific safety plans, and several districts are still working on those. In the event of a fire alarm, Perry Township Schools officials say teachers are being instructed to check hallways before evacuating classrooms, but the district does not plan to officially adopt a three-minute delay. Avon Community School officials declined to release specific details of their safety plans, but district spokesperson Stacy Moore released a statement on the issue. White River Township Fire Chief Jeremy Pell says he and other public safety officials are currently consulting with Center Grove Schools on the matter. His initial reaction to the evacuation delay option is positive. Pell said discussions with Center Grove about the evacuation policy are still ongoing.

Three weeks after the Parkland high school shooting, Florida Gov. Rick Scott has a gun-control bill on his desk that challenges the National Rifle Association but falls short of what the Republican and survivors of the massacre demanded. Now he must decide whether to sign it. Scott has not said what he will do, and he plans to take up the issue Friday with relatives of 17 people slain in the attack. He had received top marks from the lobbying group in the past for supporting gun-rights measures, and his new stance reinvigorated the gun-control movement. The NRA opposes raising age limits to buy weapons or imposing new waiting periods. State lawmakers formally delivered the reform package Thursday. The governor has 15 days to sign it, veto it or let it become law without his signature. READ MORE: Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz charged with 17 counts of murder The measure would raise the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and extend a three-day waiting period for handgun purchases to include long guns. It also would create a so-called guardian program enabling school employees and many teachers to carry handguns if they go through law enforcement training and their school districts agree to participate. Other provisions would create new mental health programs for schools and establish an anonymous tip line where students and others could report threats to schools. The bill would also ban bump stocks that allow guns to mimic fully automatic fire and seek to improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies. Survivors were split as well. Andrew Pollack, whose daughter was among those killed, said more needed to be done, but there was enough good in the bill that it should pass. The suspect in the attack, Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old former Stoneman Douglas student, faces 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder for the massacre.

This year Guilford County Schools partnered with Greensboro Water Resources. They collected water samples at each school to test for lead. This was voluntary. There are no laws requiring testing at the tap in schools or day cares. The results showed three schools had water with significantly high levels of lead. Southeast Middle School measured 194 parts per billion (ppb). The EPA says that number should be under 20 ppb. The water sample collected at Frazier Elementary School found lead at 45 ppb. And at Allen Jay Elementary School, the measurement was 19.7 ppb. Michael Borchers works with Greensboro Water Resources. He says they found the lead was entering the water at the faucet in those schools. GCS changed the three faucets at those schools. When new samples were taken, the tests showed parts per billion of less than five. Foust Elementary: 17 ppb Falkener Elementary: 13 ppb Aycock Middle: 12 ppb Hampton Elementary: 11 ppb Morehead Elementary: 8 ppb The American Academy of Pediatrics considers those numbers to be off the charts. The organization asked the EPA to improve the standard to 5 ppb because of neurological problems caused by lead exposure. The AAP disagrees when it comes to our children. Three schools were retested after remediation for higher test counts. Remediation included a flush sample (water turned on for 15 seconds) and sample after first drawn after faucet replacement. Schools and day cares do not have to test water at the tap. There is no law requiring it. There was a bill in the General Assembly to require that testing at schools built before 1987. It never made it out of committee. To read Guilford County Schools' report on lead and copper testing, click here. Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email."}

Officers exchanged gunfire with Dimitirios before a 25-minute negotiation ended in his surrender. The suspect and officers did not exchange gunfire during the negotiation, the sheriff said. Dimitirios told an investigator he acted alone and spared people he liked because he wanted his story told, according to a probable cause affidavit.

Chouteau Elementary, named for trader and purported slave owner Jean-Pierre Chouteau, according to CNN affiliate KTUL, will become Wayman Tisdale Fine Arts Academy, named for a local basketball star who became an NBA player and later a successful jazz musician before his death in 2009. The Tulsa school board approved a change for Robert E. Lee Elementary, but will decide on a new name at its next meeting in August, CNN affiliate KJRH reported. A debate surrounding what to do with Confederate names, statues and symbols has been underway in recent years since Dylann Roof killed nine African-Americans in a Charleston, South Carolina, church in 2015. And it flared up again after white nationalists marched during the summer to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a counterprotester was killed.

An Alabama school safety task force that was assembled after the Parkland, Florida, shooting recommended school resource officers for all districts. Until there are more such officers throughout the state, the sentry program is a way to protect students, Ivey said. The Alabama Sentry Program is to start in the upcoming school year with training for administrators to begin this summer. If a school shooting occurs, the sentry is to wear a designated bullet-proof vest that would be easily identifiable, so responding officers would be able to recognize it. A state school safety team will determine what type of firearms and weapons storage system will be allowed. The sentries and the local board of education will be responsible for getting and maintaining the weapon, its storage system, ammunition and the bullet-proof vest. The controversy over arming school staff In the months since the school shooting in Parkland, several states have proposed bills or resolutions related to arming school personnel, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. After a high school shooting that left 10 dead in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott announced a plan Wednesday to improve school safety that included more armed school marshals in classrooms. The concept of arming teachers or school personnel has been controversial as some critics argue that it poses dangers for students of color and has a militarizing effect on schools. School officials have other jobs they are meant to be doing. Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

Bruder, Education Superintendent Molly Spearman and State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel all told lawmakers their first priority is armed officers. About half of South Carolina's more than 1,200 schools have armed officers, with a greater proportion in middle and high schools. He has since said the state should find whatever money is needed to make children safe. The House passed its spending plan last week without that money, but the Senate has yet to take up the spending bills. Along with supporting the idea of armed officers, most of the people testifying before lawmakers March 21 also said the state needs to provide more mental health help in schools. That money had to be taken from the classroom, Dobbins said. Rep. Phillip Lowe asked Keel and Spearman if they would give up any money from their budgets for extra officers for schools, then the Florence Republican spoke in support of his bill arming a small number of teachers or other school staff in a pilot program. Rep. Wendell Gilliard said the state finds solutions to other problems that aren't as important as saving the lives of children all the time. There was less interest in other ideas. Several speakers also questioned if it was wise to have one employee monitor 200 cameras or more in large schools and whether those surveillance cameras should be put in classrooms too. No one spoke in favor of allowing teachers to have guns. Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery."}

Police arrested 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz for killing 17 people at the high school. The three videos released by prosecutors were found on the cellphone of suspect Nikolas Cruz after the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people and injured 17 others. He goes on to say that he wants to use an AR-15 to kill at least 20 people and specifies the high school in Parkland. Today it all begins. In a second video, Cruz briefly discusses logistics, including that he will take Uber to campus about 2:40. I live in seclusion and solitude. I hate everyone and everything. But the power of my AR you will all know who I am. Cruz is charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the attack. His lawyers have repeatedly said Cruz would plead guilty if guaranteed a sentence of life without parole, but prosecutors refuse to waive the death penalty. Cruz, 19, is a former Stoneman Douglas student. Cruz spent several years at a school for children with emotional disabilities before being allowed to transfer to Stoneman Douglas. He spent several months there before being kicked out. His late mother also called 911 on him almost 20 times over the years and he had a history of killing animals then posting images on the internet and taking body parts as souvenirs.

But the review will go further to include which procedures and circumstances may have affected the tragedy, Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said. Two months before the massacre at Stoneman Douglas High School, a retired Secret Service agent warned administrators that the school could be vulnerable to a gunman. Gates were unlocked. Students did not wear identification badges. A fire alarm could send students streaming into the halls. Active-shooter... In December 2017, Wexler warned administrators the school could be vulnerable to a gunman. Wexler had conducted a security review of the school at the request of administrators and presented his findings to four staff members, but he never heard back from anyone at the school, he said. The Sun Sentinel reported on June 8 that Wexler had given a highly critical assessment of lax school security at Stoneman Douglas. The district cited legal protections governing school security in blacking out the information. Also attending the meeting were Security Specialist Kevin Greenleaf, Assistant Principal Denise Reed and a teacher. Wexler had staged a mock scenario of an irate parent storming campus and successfully shooting people, exposing vulnerabilities to the administrative team. Gunsmoke set off the fire alarm in the massacre, drawing children into the hallways. Philip Schentrup, whose daughter Carmen was killed in the massacre, said he thinks Thompson and Greenleaf should be removed from the school while the new review takes place. Runcie said neither was a specific target of the review and said they would remain in place while the review is done. Interviews,... Schentrup attended a School Board meeting Tuesday and blamed the two for flaws at the school that he said contributed to the massacre. On the day of the shooting, administrators called for an evacuation, sending students outside of their classrooms, while Cruz was in the hallway firing, Schentrup said. He accused Greenleaf of standing outside the building where the shooting happened and failing to call for an emergency lockdown. Thompson was not on campus at the time of the shooting. When the shooting occurred Feb. 14, Thompson was on a plane that was still on the ground, headed on a vacation. Upon hearing the news, he immediately got off the plane and made his way to campus by about 5 p.m., a district spokeswoman said. This is the latest in a number of reviews and investigations. A state Marjory Stoneman Douglas Commission is also evaluating what went wrong on Feb. 14 and the days leading up to it. Runcie said his original plan was to use those findings to understand what role school staff played, but as that investigation is expected to take about a year, he said he wanted to get answers more quickly. So far two Stoneman Douglas security monitors, Andrew Medina and David Taylor, have lost their jobs since the shooting. Runcie chose not to renew either of them for the new school year. Both were criticized for their perceived inaction during the shooting. He said he instead radioed Taylor, who hid in a closet."}

The teen, who has not been named, is in custody. The incident was the latest in a series of shootings at U.S. schools that has fueled debate about access to guns in America. Many schools have beefed up security precautions since 2012, when a gunman shot and killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Anderson County sheriff's deputies and investigators gather outside of Townville Elementary School after a shooting in Townville, South Carolina, U.S., September 28, 2016. Hollingsworth shepherded students inside to safety and urged medical staff to care for the injured children before her, he said. Jamie Brock, a 30-year veteran of the Townville Volunteer Fire Department, was unarmed when he confronted the shooter and pinned him down for police, McAdams said. Brock has declined media interviews, saying he wanted the focus to remain on the victims. Authorities said they did not know of any connection between the shooter and the school victims but had ruled out terrorism and ethnicity as motivating factors. The suspect, who was home-schooled, was emotional when he called his grandparents Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. The teenager was gone. His mother offered no insight into his motive in a statement released to media on her behalf on Thursday.

Seventeen people were killed. Published OnFeb. Students huddled in horror in their classrooms, with some of them training their cellphones on the carnage, capturing sprawled bodies, screams and gunfire that began with a few shots and then continued with more and more. The dead included students and adults, some of whom were shot outside the school and others inside the sprawling three-story building. The gunman, armed with a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle, was identified as Nikolas Cruz, a 19-year-old who had been expelled from the school, the authorities said. He began his shooting rampage outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in this suburban neighborhood shortly before dismissal time around 2:40 p.m. He then made his way inside and proceeded down hallways he knew well, firing at students and teachers who were scurrying for cover, the authorities said.

CreditSaul Martinez for The New York Times By the end of the rampage, Mr. Cruz had killed 12 people inside the school and three outside it, including someone standing on a street corner, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said. Two more victims died of their injuries in local hospitals. The aftermath at the school was an eerie shrine, with chairs upended, a computer screen shattered with bullet holes and floors stained with blood. On Thursday, the authorities charged Mr. Cruz with 17 counts of premeditated murder. Mr. Cruz was arrested in Coral Springs, a neighboring city a couple of miles from the school, about an hour after fleeing the scene, the authorities said. He had slipped out of the building by mixing in with crowds of students. The gunman had clearly prepared for the attack, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said in an interview after speaking to the F.B.I. Several students said they found it strange to hear the alarm, because they had already had a fire drill earlier in the day. He said a football coach was among the dead, and the son of a deputy sheriff among the injured. Twelve of the 17 dead had been identified by Wednesday night, he added, noting that not all of the students had backpacks or wallets on them. Mr. Cruz was enrolled at another Broward County school, officials said. After Sandy Hook, More Than 400 People Have Been Shot in Over 200 School Shootings Since 26 people were killed in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, a nonprofit that tracks school shootings has recorded five a month, on average. Two 15-year-old students were killed and 18 more people were injured last month in a school in rural Benton, Ky. The shootings have become common enough that many schools, including Stoneman Douglas High, run annual drills in which students practice huddling in classrooms behind locked doors. With the Parkland shooting, three of the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern United States history have come in the last five months. Image Lavinia Zapata embraced Jorge, her son, after the shooting. CreditSaul Martinez for The New York Times Mr. Nelson said the episode made him relive recent shootings that also shook the state. After the gunfire had stopped Wednesday afternoon and Mr. Cruz had fled, students ran out of the school, some in single file with their hands on the shoulders of those in front of them and others in all-out sprints. As the students sought cover, law enforcement officers armed with military-grade weapons swarmed the building. Parents rushed to a local Marriott hotel to reunite with their children. Noelle Kaiser, 17, was in history class when a fire alarm went off. The class was gathered just outside the building when she heard three distinct gunshots.

Stoneman Douglas High is among the largest in the Broward school district, with about 3,000 students. The school will remain closed for the rest of the week. Gov. Rick Scott directed the state to lower its flags at half-staff until Monday. As the authorities frantically searched for the person responsible, they asked residents of the city to avoid the area around the school. For hours, parents were lined along Coral Springs Drive, calling their children on cellphones and pacing. Some parents said their children told them only to text to not make noise. One parent of two daughters at a nearby middle school said he sat in a bank lobby near the school and prayed. The gunfire came as some students were still staring at chalkboards and listening to lectures. Rebecca Bogart, 17, a senior, said her teacher was finishing up a discussion of the Holocaust when she heard a series of loud bangs.

Reply Christina October 2nd, 2016 This is just so sad a little innocent boy life was taking because of a teenager who hated his life. Reply Gina October 2nd, 2016 Agreed. Reply Anonymous October 1st, 2016 I feel so sad for little Jacob and his family. This kid needed therapy and should have been watched closely or charged with the first crime. He was mentally ill and needed help, but it seems he was left to deal with his issues on his own. I know that they would trade places with their baby. I am glad to leave weapons out of reach of all kids. Simply awful to read this news. Reply Carol Brown October 1st, 2016 Thank you. People tell things they have no Proof at all.

The alleged shooter used a shotgun and a revolver that were legally owned by his father, Abbott told reporters. Live updates on the school shooting Early morning attack Gunfire erupted at the school, about 20 miles outside Galveston, not long after classes began around 7:30 a.m. CT, officials said. The male that Gonzalez described as a suspect is injured, a law enforcement official said on condition of anonymity. Investigators believe that the second person, an 18-year-old, may be an accomplice but not a shooter, a law enforcement official said. Two law enforcement officers are among the injured, according to a law enforcement source. One man is in critical condition with a gunshot wound in one of his arms, said David Marshall, chief nursing officer for University of Texas Medical Branch hospital. This is the 22nd US school shooting since the beginning of the year, and the third instance in eight days in which a gunman was on a school campus. Authorities found explosive devices in the high school and in adjacent areas, said Walter Braun, Santa Fe Independent School District police chief. Investigators Friday afternoon were searching a trailer where they believe the devices were assembled, a law enforcement source said. The school has been cleared of all students and staff, who have been directed to a nearby facility to reunite with their families, Braun said. Witness: Shooter fired gun in an art class An armed person walked into an art class at the school and began firing what looked like a shotgun, a witness told CNN affiliate KTRK. The witness told KTRK she saw a girl shot in the leg. At least 13 people from the school were being treated at three hospitals, authorities said. Eight people were at Clear Lake Regional Medical in Webster, Texas; two patients were being treated at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City; and three patients are at John Sealy University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Six of the eight patients at Clare Lake Regional were discharged by Friday afternoon. Aerial video from the scene showed several police officers outside the school. Some were searching students and their backpacks. The witness who spoke to KTRK also said she heard an alarm. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told CNN affiliate KPRC that she heard gunshots only after hearing an alarm in the school. MaKenna Evans, a 16-year-old sophomore, told CNN she was in geometry class when the shooting started. First, she heard a fire alarm, she said. When the students got outside, her principal told them all to run. Evans said students hid behind a building across the street from the school. The high school has about 1,400 students, according to GreatSchools.org. On Wednesday, an Illinois school resource officer shot and wounded a former student who fired a weapon near a graduation rehearsal at Dixon High School, authorities said. The suspected gunman faces three charges of aggravated discharge of a firearm. On May 11, a 14-year-old boy in In Palmdale, California, went to Highland High, his former school, and began shooting a semiautomatic rifle shortly before classes began, authorities said. He was taken into custody and is accused of attempted murder. One person was wounded. Too many years. Trump said federal authorities are coordinating with local officials.

{"URL_s":"https://fox2now.com/2018/08/15/how-to-design-a-school-in-the-era-of-mass-shootings","Timestamp_s":"20180819063452","Sentences_t":"For school designers and architects, the current debate about how to make schools safer focuses too much on add-on measures. They also must be balanced with the need to create an environment where kids feel inspired and energized to learn. Their answers, which follow a theory known as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, illuminate the delicate balance between security and education. It should be lit with daylight. Perimeter landscaping that makes visitors visible One main idea of designing safety is to create several layers of security, or concentric rings of access, starting with the perimeter and then working inward into the school. If there is an intruder, each layer of security is designed to delay him or her until first responders can arrive. The outermost layer of security is the landscape leading up to the entrance. Designers said they try to create a perimeter where everyone has to walk up on foot, so that people inside the school can easily see who is coming. In practice, that means the area around the entrance might have a pathway through a low shrubbery or a garden, so that there are no places to hide. Some schools might have a pedestrian bridge out front to funnel visitors to that main entrance. In addition, visitor parking lots and bus dropoffs are located in separate areas further from the school entrance, so visitors have to walk to the entrance. Bollards or strategically placed planters near the entrance can also be used to prevent someone driving into the building. The idea is to have a better way to control who visits the schools and, in the case of an emergency, to create an additional barrier to anyone seeking to do harm. Architects are designing schools where visitors encounter a single entrance point in a vestibule or antechamber. The visitors then must talk to an administrator or secretary to present their ID and reason for being there, and only then are they allowed to pass through another set of doors to get into the school. For example, the firm Fanning Howey built the West Muskingum Learning Center in Zanesville, Ohio with a vestibule that leads visitors to a front office. These vestibule doors are generally left open during the morning and afternoon rush and then closed once classes begin. There are also many one-way exits around the school that can be opened in case of a fire or other emergency. Reinforced doors During the Sandy Hook shooting, the gunman used an assault weapon to shoot through the vestibule glass and enter the building. That has become a robust market for some businesses. Total Security Solutions mainly works to reinforce the vestibule at the single entrance point of the school. Other designers add a security film to the glass in the vestibule entrance with the idea of slowing down an intruder. The vestibules and hardened doors can also host metal detectors. However, their use remains a fraught issue among designers and security experts who say metal detectors may not be helpful in stopping an intruder and create unintended consequences, such as logjams. More importantly, they say, metal detectors send the wrong message to students. Wider, open hallways New schools also are being designed with wide, open hallways that provide clear lines of sight. Having open hallways without nooks and crannies also gives surveillance cameras a fuller view of the school. In modern schools, these hallways function as throughways as well as collaborative working spaces similar to a Starbucks, Nigaglioni said. These open hallways also can be sealed off electronically in the case of an emergency, adding one more layer of security. In a lockdown, students would go to their classrooms and lock that door, too, creating yet another barrier. The overall idea is to create a collaborative learning environment that can function as another zone of security to allow time for police to arrive. Pruchnicki, of Bond Architects, said that classrooms are now labeled with large numbers that jut out from the wall. Of course, school security is much more than just the threat of active shootings. The newest school designs have multiple focuses to address all of these issues. Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved. E-mail us.

There, as children were led outside for recess, the teenager rammed the truck into a chainlink fence surrounding the playground, stepped out and opened fire, authorities said. A bullet struck student Jacob Hall in the leg and a second boy was shot in the foot. First-grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth managed to herd the children to safety inside the building even as she was shot in the shoulder. Among those heading out to the playground was Katrina Jones' 6-year-old niece. I was just trying to figure out what was going on and if my son was OK. Hall was airlifted to the Pediatric Trauma Center at Greenville Health System where he was listed in critical condition Wednesday night. Hollingsworth was treated and released from AnMed, as was the student shot in the foot. By day's end, Brock and Hollingsworth along with Anderson County emergency responders and others at the school were hailed as heroes whose quick action may have saved countless lives. Nor could they say whether he had any connection to the three. Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said the teenager was alone at home with his father when he shot him multiple times in the den. Osborne's wife was at work at the time, he said. A Townville Elementary student weeps as she and her classmates are transported to Oakdale Baptist Church following a shooting at Townville Elementary that claimed one adult life and injured two children on Wednesday, September 28, 2016 in Townville. A neighbor who was sitting on his front porch said the Osbornes had lived there for at least 10 years and kept a chicken farm for most of that time. He said he saw Osborne Wednesday morning and waved. The only odd thing he remembers is hearing gunshots from the farm two nights ago. The neighbor said he thought the shots were for target practice.

No, really. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) clearly show that school-age children die every year in far greater numbers outside of school in a variety of ways. Take a look at the raw data. According to statistics compiled by The Washington Post, 80 students died in shootings at elementary, middle and high schools from 2000 to 2016. That includes 11 students who committed suicide. Considering there are more than 50 million schoolchildren, that makes homicide victims in schools vanishingly rare. At home or on the streets is where the vast majority of school-age homicide victims meet their end. The CDC data show that during the same time period, a total of 34,227 children ages 5 to 18 died from gunfire. Suicides made up nearly a third of that total, 10,779. Accidental gun deaths accounted for another 1,694 deaths. But it is not only guns awaiting our progeny when they are not at school. The CDC statistics show children have died in much greater numbers due to a variety of more exotic causes of death. Some 8,555 drowned during that 17-year period. Of those, 155 were suicides. So more children intentionally drowned themselves than suffered fatal gunshots at school. Schools are safe places for your kids. When you compare those two numbers, you see an extremely low percentage experiencing anything of the sort. The risk is actually minimal. Now, it should be noted that while only 80 died in that 17-year span, we already have a significant percentage of that number in 2018 so far. I get that. Yet there were 50.7 million kids attending public school in 2017. To those loved ones, the loss is a devastating tragedy. I could only imagine what it would be like to lose one of my kids to anything. I get that. However, we also need to look at the bigger picture when we talk about the risk to our children. They have more to worry about from the typical stupid kid stuff than they do about an active shooter entering the building. He lives with his family in Southwest Georgia. Media.

In a meeting dominated by issues related to the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Parkland, the School Board declined to participate in the Coach Aaron Feis Guardian Program. The School Board also was blasted by some parents and a student attending the meeting regarding what they saw as failures by the district. Lisa Olsen, whose son William was struck by gunfire during the shooting, received an apology from two School Board members after saying district officials failed to reach out to either of them to see how they were doing. She claimed district officials were too busy lobbying for gun control and other political causes to show any compassion for what her son had been through. She said her son received hugs from President Trump and first lady Melania Trump, Gov. Rick Scott and other state and national politicians who visited Parkland but they received no support from the district. Freedman said she initially had a list only of the 17 who died, not the 17 who were injured. Freedman said federal health privacy laws made it difficult for her to find out who was injured. The board was also criticized by Kenneth Preston, a 19-year-old student from Pembroke Pines. Since the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, governments and businesses have made changes to gun and safety policies in response. The Sun Sentinel will continue tracking changes that been made to federal, state and local laws and regulations as well as... Two School Board members say quotes attributed to them from public meetings were taken out of context. And Runcie brought about 10 administrators with him, Preston said. He has said the district is expediting funds for fences and gates designed to limit visitor access to the school to just the front office, with plans to have all schools completed by early next year. Runcie announced Tuesday the school district is holding a community forum on school safety and security, where the public can ask questions and voice their concerns. The meeting will be from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m April 18 at Plantation High School. The idea was originally to allow classroom teachers to be armed, but opposition killed that plan. Instead, the law allows librarians, administrators, coaches, ROTC instructors and others to have weapons. The employees must undergo 132 hours of firearms training. The School Board said it wants the state to allow it to use some of the money to hire more school police officers. Gov. Scott said in a letter to superintendents he plans to redirect any unused money to school resource officers. However, hiring more officers may also prove to be a challenge. State funding could increase that demand by about 5,000 police officers statewide. It was included in a motion supporting gun control that the School Board passed March 6. That resolution was geared toward proposals by the federal government. Many other large school districts passed similar measures. So far, none of the 10 largest school districts in Florida have indicated any interest in arming anyone on school campuses other than law enforcement."}

The statement, issued through a law firm, says the family is cooperating with investigators and will make no other public comments until the fact-finding stage is completed. Pagourtzis is being held without bail and is accused of capital murder of multiple people and aggravated assault on a public servant. He has not entered a plea. Under Texas law, offenders who are under age 18 and charged with a capital offense face a maximum punishment of life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years, according to Robert Dunham of the Death Penalty Information Center. Police say Pagourtzis used a shotgun and a revolver to shoot students and teachers at Santa Fe High School on Friday morning. Pagourtzis told an investigator he acted alone and spared people he liked because he wanted his story told, a probable cause affidavit says. One of the students who was killed was Jared Black, who turned 17 this week and was supposed to have a birthday party Saturday. A family friend told CNN his family learned of his death about 13 hours after the shooting. Officers were escorting people back to the campus Saturday in groups of 10 to collect things such as valuables, keys and vehicles, school district Police Chief Walter Braun said. Fifty had returned to the school by the afternoon. A shotgun and a .38 revolver The alleged shooter used a shotgun and a .38 revolver legally owned by his father, Gov. Greg Abbott told reporters. Gunfire started not long after classes began around 7:30 a.m. (8:30 a.m. ET), officials said. Two school resource officers were on the campus and confronted the shooter, Abbott said. Henry told reporters that the suspect had devices but none were functional. One was a pressure cooker with an alarm clock and nails, but no explosive material. Authorities also found an unlit Molotov cocktail, he said. Investigators on Friday searched a trailer where they believe the devices were assembled, a law enforcement source said. Investigators believe Pagourtzis acted alone, a law enforcement official told CNN on Saturday. Earlier, Abbott and other officials indicated that two other people were being interviewed to see whether they were involved. But authorities now believe those two were not connected to the crime, the official said. Exchange student among those killed The people hospitalized included retired Houston police Officer John Barnes, who served as a resource officer at the school. Barnes was in critical condition, the University of Texas Medical Branch said Saturday. This is the 22nd US school shooting so far this year, and the third instance in eight days in which a gunman was on a school campus. Gunshots in an art room, and a fire alarm A student, Damon Rabon, said he was in class when he heard a loud bang next door. Rabon said he followed his teacher, who went to investigate. They heard three more bangs and saw the shooter come out of an art room. They went back into their classroom and told others to help barricade the door. A substitute teacher, David Briscoe, said he was teaching an English class when he heard screaming and gunshots, then a fire alarm. Not knowing where the shooter was, he barricaded his classroom door with tables and desks, turned off the lights and told his students to get down. He told CNN he could hear someone outside the room groaning, apparently injured. Angelica Martinez, 14, told CNN that an alarm sounded, as well as gunfire. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told KPRC that she heard gunshots after the alarm blared. Too many years. Trump said federal authorities are coordinating with local officials.

All three of them are expected to survive. The teenaged suspect was arrested at the school. The suspect is believed to have murdered his father at a home on a dead-end gravel road 3.5 miles away prior to the school attack. After the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut in 2012, the National Rifle Association (NRA) formally proposed the National School Shield Program. In specific, the NRA called for armed school resource officers (SROs) to be deployed to all schools in the United States. Almost exactly a year after Sandy Hook, an armed SRO cornered a would-be mass shooter at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colorado. The gunman, who had a hit list, a shotgun, 125 rounds of ammunition, and three Molotov cocktails, committed suicide as the deputy closed in on him. Because of the school SRO, the attack was over inside 80 seconds. Reynolds High School in Troutdale, Oregon, employs multiple on-campus SROs. In June of 2014, two of them engaged a would-be mass-murderer armed with a stolen AR-15 and 9 30-round magazines inside of a minute and forced him to take cover in a bathroom, where he took his life. In a typical mass shooting scenario, a person is shot every 20 seconds. In an elementary school, where small children have nowhere to run and are too small to easily escape, the carnage can be much worse, much faster. Even a relatively fast response time of five minutes gave the Sandy Hook shooter enough time to shoot 20 children and six adults. Most of the victims were shot repeatedly.

Two injured in Maryland school shooting 01:00 (CNN)A 17-year-old male student shot two other students at Great Mills High School in Maryland on Tuesday morning before a school resource officer engaged him and stopped the threat, authorities said. The incident began in a school hallway at 7:55 a.m., just before classes started. Authorities say Austin Wyatt Rollins, armed with a handgun, shot a female and a male student. The shooter had a prior relationship with the female student, St. Mary's County Sheriff Tim Cameron said. School resource officer Blaine Gaskill responded to the scene in less than a minute, the sheriff said. Gaskill fired a round at the shooter, and the shooter fired a round simultaneously, Cameron said. Lone resource officer's quick action stopped the Maryland school shooter within seconds Rollins was later pronounced dead. Gaskill was unharmed. The 16-year-old female student is in critical condition with life-threatening injuries, and the 14-year-old male student who was shot is in stable condition. Cameron said he was not sure whether Gaskill's bullet hit the suspect, but he praised the officer's quick response to the situation. The incident is the 17th school shooting in the United States since January 1, according to CNN research. The school was on lockdown for a brief time, and students were evacuated from Great Mills High School to a reunification center at a nearby high school, the school system said. Toni Foreman, who lives near the suspect and his family in nearby Lexington Park, said he was a good kid from a nice family who used to play catch and ride bikes with her son.

A position statement by the Indiana Fire Chiefs Association said fire chiefs around the state were being asked how to officially and safely remove pull-stations in a school building. Those conversations prompted a message of caution from some fire officials. The law addressing fire evacuation delays leaves room for schools to adopt locally-specific safety plans, and several districts are still working on those. In the event of a fire alarm, Perry Township Schools officials say teachers are being instructed to check hallways before evacuating classrooms, but the district does not plan to officially adopt a three-minute delay. Avon Community School officials declined to release specific details of their safety plans, but district spokesperson Stacy Moore released a statement on the issue. White River Township Fire Chief Jeremy Pell says he and other public safety officials are currently consulting with Center Grove Schools on the matter. His initial reaction to the evacuation delay option is positive. Pell said discussions with Center Grove about the evacuation policy are still ongoing.

Supporters including community members and alumni lined the streets to cheer on the students as they made their way to school. Students and teachers from neighboring districts joined the crowd. Andi Lewis, a teacher from Pima, Texas, drove with students for more than an hour to show support. Others tried to shield the students from media by holding signs and umbrellas in front of cameras. At Santa Fe High School, students, staff, parents and community attended a general assembly with a special visitor, Gov. Greg Abbott. The governor discussed the events of May 18 as well as a school safety plan he will unveil Wednesday, Santa Fe Independent School District said on Tuesday. The governor honored law enforcement with special commendations for their heroism during the shooting and conducted roundtable discussions with students, parents and teachers. Large police presence Students encountered a large police presence that included reinforcements from state and Houston law enforcement agencies. Officers guarded school entrances and a long line leading out of the building suggested increased security measures inside. Parent and visitor check-in took longer than usual due to additional security measures implemented on every campus throughout the district, the district said. Teachers returned to work last Wednesday. In addition to increased security, the school district provided counseling resources in locations throughout the district. On the eve of their return students expressed mixed emotions about returning. Some students told local media that they wanted to graduate at their campus and that they wanted to see their classmates and friends for the final days of school. Police say accused gunman Dimitrios Pagourtzis said he meant to kill the people he targeted and avoided those he liked. He is charged with multiple counts of capital murder in the deaths of eight students and two teachers. Thirteen people were injured in the shooting.

(CNN)Another high school has turned into a scene of carnage, this time in western Kentucky. Sixteen people were wounded, two of them fatally, after a shooter opened fire Tuesday morning at Marshall County High School, authorities said. Four others sustained various injuries. Video shows high school after shooting 02:11 A 15-year-old male student was arrested at the scene, Gov. Matt Bevin said. On Wednesday he was charged with two counts of murder and 12 counts of first degree assault, Marshall County Assistant Attorney Jason Darnall told reporters. After the boy has a probable cause hearing and a detention hearing in the next two days, prosecutors will start the process of charging him as an adult, Darnall said. A grand jury will meet on February 13, and the charges could change, Darnall said. Read More Authorities identified the slain victims as Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, both 15. Bailey died at the high school, and Preston died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, according to Kentucky State Police Commissioner Richard W. Sanders. Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, both 15, were killed in the shooting. Sanders said the suspect, armed with a handgun, walked into the school at 8:57 a.m. ET and started shooting. The first 911 call came two minutes later. The victims ranged from 14 to 18, state police said. Fourteen were male and six female. 'Mom, there's been a shooting' Some parents said their children told them the shooting started in the commons area before class, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. Missy Hufford said her son, Ethan, 15, ran into the gymnasium and out of the building through a side door. Then he called and asked her to pick him up, she said. Junior Taylor Droke told CNN affiliate WZTV that she and a friend were running late and arrived as students poured out of the school. Droke said she contacted her mother on FaceTime. Then she and her friend gave a ride to some students and loaned them phones to call their parents. His parents kept calling his cell phone until someone in the emergency room picked up and said Daniel had been shot. Daniel Austin, right, was wounded in Tuesday's shooting at Marshall County High School. His mother, Andrea, rushed to the hospital, bewildered as to why this happened. Students love him. Austin said her son was shot in the right arm, which might need to be amputated. She lauded the heroics of a fellow student and a teacher, who quickly scooped up Daniel after the gunfire stopped, rushed him to a car and drove him to a hospital. Trooper thought deceased victim was his daughter Sanders, the state police commissioner, said authorities are praying for the victims. The carnage was especially hard on first responders. One of the first state troopers to arrive at the high school thought Bailey, the student who died at the school, was his daughter, Sanders said. The trooper's daughter had been dropped off at the school that morning, and she and the victim were wearing similar clothing, Sanders said. State police said six victims, including Preston, were taken to Vanderbilt in Nashville, about 100 miles away. Among the injuries, three students were shot in the head, Dr. Oscar Guillamondegui, medical director of Vanderbilt's trauma intensive care unit, told reporters.

The teenager is charged with two counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder and five counts of a weapons charge after investigators said he shot his father to death before driving to Townville Elementary School's playground and opening fire. The coroner identified the victims as 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne and 6-year-old Jacob Hall. SLIDESHOW: Hearing underway in deadly Townville school shooting case In October 2016, the Solicitor's Office filed a motion to have the suspect tried as an adult in the case. Because of his age, if he were to be tried as an adult he would not be eligible for the death penalty but could face a sentence of up to life in prison Beginning Monday, a judge will consider the seriousness of the offense and whether or not being in a juvenile setting would adequately rehabilitate the suspect if he is found guilty. The suspect, now 15, arrived for Monday's hearing in a wheelchair. His attorney stated that the teen broke his leg while playing basketball while in juvenile jail. PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Townville school shooting headlines LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TAKE THE STAND Anderson County deputies and an FBI agent were the first to take the stand when testimony began in the hearing on Monday. Ronald Wood with the Anderson County Sheriff's Office testified that the defendant stated that he was sorry and was crying. Wood said the suspect also told him that he knew he had killed his father and that he would have shot more people if he was able. Wood also testified about speaking to the teen's grandfather, who reportedly told him that the teen was home schooled because he had been bullied in school and that the boy spent most of the time in his room due to alcohol issues in the home. Later, the defendant's attorney, Frank Epps, grilled Detective Tracy Call over how the defendant was mirandized and if special care was used when reading and explaining the teen's rights. Call testified that his only interaction with the suspect occurred at the sheriff's office when the teen was interviewed, and that he felt the teen understood his rights. Call said they defendant never asked for an attorney or his mother during the interview. Anderson County Detective Grady Epps also testified that if the defendant had asked for an attorney or for his family, the interview would have stopped immediately until those parties could be present. Frank Epps argued that the suspect, who was 14 at the time, could not understand his constitutional rights and effectively make a decision to waive those rights at that age. Video of the sheriff's office's interview with the suspect was played during the hearing, but the media was not allowed to view the recording. CONFESSION TRANSCRIPT The court released 46 pages transcribed from a video during which time they said the suspect confessed to the shooting. The defense attorney for the suspect has argued the confession should not be admissible and said a parent or lawyer should have been present when the teen was questioned. The judge, however, said the suspect volunteered his confession and allowed it to be used in court. In the document, the suspect tells investigators that he had faced bullying and was angry. He also said he believed God caused the gun to jam, stopping him from shooting more victims, the document states. So I can understand that. I was thinking 20, 30 kids. Now I know that he is real. PRINCIPAL TESTIFIES Principal Denise Fredericks was the first witness to testify on Tuesday. She was asked about the day of the deadly shooting and described the moment she saw that Jacob Hall had been badly injured. She recalled looking out a window and recognizing the suspect as a former student. Fredericks said the suspect had been a good student and everyone remembered him fondly from his time at the school. Fredericks testified that many children were unable to return to school after the tragedy. She said some had transferred and others are now being home schooled. She said many students are still fearful of another shooting. Safety drills have to be conducted differently now due to the trauma, and Fredericks said balloons can no longer be used during school celebrations because the sound of popping frightens the children. She said the school continues to see the effects on the students on a daily basis. Next, Pamela Sanchez, a first grade teaching assistant took the stand. She testified that Jacob Hall called for her after he had been shot and told her that his leg hurt. She said she carried the six-year-old into the school hallway and then made sure the door to the playground was locked. When she returned seconds later, Sanchez said Jacob was already turning gray. Thirdly, Jamie Brock, the Townville firefighter who apprehended the suspect and held him at gunpoint until deputies arrived. Brock was hailed as a hero after the shooting but had not spoken publicly about the incident until he gave his testimony on Tuesday. FBI AGENT TESTIFIES ABOUT TROUBLING SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS FBI Special Agent Shandal Ewing testified on Tuesday regarding the messages sent from an Instagram account operated by the suspect. Timestamps on messages indicate the suspect was sending them before and after authorities say he shot his father to death. READ MORE: FBI details messages sent by Townville shooting suspect DAY 3 OF TESTIMONY Special Agent Ewing continued to testify on Wednesday as the defense asked numerous questions about the Instagram messages and who the suspect had been interacting with. During the questioning, attorneys asked Ewing to read an exchange between the suspect and another person that included instructions which seemed to detail how to build a pipe bomb.

The school provided grief counseling and orientation for students who might be having difficulty coping with the recent tragedy. The school day was about 20 minutes from dismissal as Andrew Medina, a baseball coach and unarmed campus monitor, noticed Nikolas Cruz while riding his golf cart around the Marjory Stoneman Douglas campus unlocking gates. He was the same kid who had been sent to the office for wearing a camo mask, hiding behind poles and jumping out to scare students.

Early morning attack Gunfire erupted at the school, about 20 miles outside Galveston, not long after classes began around 7:30 a.m. CT, officials said. Authorities later found explosive devices -- including pipe bombs and pressure cookers -- in and near the school, the law enforcement official said. A male suspect, believed to be a student, has been arrested in the shooting, and a second person -- also believed to be a student -- has been detained as well, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. The male that Gonzalez described as a suspect is injured, a law enforcement official said on condition of anonymity. Investigators believe that the second person, an 18-year-old, may be an accomplice but not a shooter, a law enforcement official said. Two law enforcement officers are among the injured, according to a law enforcement source. One man is in critical condition with a gunshot wound in one of his arms, said David Marshall, chief nursing officer for University of Texas Medical Branch hospital. This is the 22nd US school shooting since the beginning of the year, and the third instance in eight days in which a gunman was on a school campus. Witnesses described students running from the school as they heard gunshots; they also described hearing an alarm at the school, though the sequence of events wasn't immediately clear. Authorities found explosive devices in the high school and in adjacent areas, said Walter Braun, Santa Fe Independent School District police chief. It wasn't immediately clear if any had exploded. Investigators Friday afternoon were searching a trailer where they believe the devices were assembled, a law enforcement source said. The school has been cleared of all students and staff, who have been directed to a nearby facility to reunite with their families, Braun said. Witness: Shooter fired gun in an art class An armed person walked into an art class at the school and began firing what looked like a shotgun, a witness told KTRK. The witness told KTRK she saw a girl shot in the leg. At least 13 people from the school were being treated at three hospitals, authorities said. Eight people were at Clear Lake Regional Medical in Webster, Texas; two patients were being treated at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City; and three patients are at John Sealy University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Six of the eight patients at Clare Lake Regional were discharged by Friday afternoon. Aerial video from the scene showed several police officers outside the school. Some were searching students and their backpacks. The witness who spoke to KTRK also said she heard an alarm. She didn't specify if that was before or after the gunfire she described in the art class. She said she couldn't describe the shooter. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told KPRC that she heard gunshots only after hearing an alarm in the school. MaKenna Evans, a 16-year-old sophomore, told CNN she was in geometry class when the shooting started. First, she heard a fire alarm, she said. When the students got outside, her principal told them all to run. Evans said students hid behind a building across the street from the school. The high school has about 1,400 students, according to GreatSchools.org. Three gun incidents in eight days Friday's shooting was the third time someone with a gun was reported on a US school in recent days. On Wednesday, an Illinois school resource officer shot and wounded a former student who fired a weapon near a graduation rehearsal at Dixon High School, authorities said. The suspected gunman faces three charges of aggravated discharge of a firearm. On May 11, a 14-year-old boy in In Palmdale, California, went to Highland High, his former school, and began shooting a semiautomatic rifle shortly before classes began, authorities said. He was taken into custody and is accused of attempted murder. One person was wounded. Too many years. Trump said federal authorities are coordinating with local officials.

Lt. Sheila Cole of the Sheriff's Office said in an email that the video footage is exempt from release under South Carolina law. The shooting in Townville has gaining national and international attention. Jesse Osborne, 14, is charged in the shooting. The teen is accused of killing his father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne, in their Townville home Sept. 28, then taking his truck to the school about 3 miles away. Investigators say the teen opened fire at the school, wounding two 6-year-old students, hurting a third student, and shooting a first-grade teacher. One of the students, 6-year-old Jacob Hall, died of his injuries Oct. 1. The Sheriff's Office also said this week that supplemental reports filed after the shooting are exempt from public disclosure. Bender said the Sheriff's Office may claim, but should have to prove, that releasing supplemental reports would harm the potential prosecution of the case. The Sheriff's Office did release an incident report filed about the shooting. The report describes how the first deputies responding to the school found that a fireman, now known to be Jamie Brock, had pinned down the alleged shooter. One 911 call, made from or near the Osborne home, remains under review by authorities and has not been made public."}

One child has been airlifted to nearby Greenville Trauma Center while the other child and teacher were taken by ambulance to AnMed Health Medical Center in Anderson. No other information regarding the victims has yet been released by officials, including names, ages, or medical conditions, however WJTX 4 reported via Twitter that the coroner has said the students' injuries appear to be non-life threatening. According to a press release from the Oconee County Sheriff's Office, the shooting was reported to police at 1:44 p.m. Eastern Time and officers arrived on the scene before 2 p.m. Many students were picked up by their parents or guardians at the scene, while remaining students were evacuated from the scene bussed to Oakdale Baptist Church. Police are asking all family members to go to the church to pick up their children and not the school. Townville Elementary School is one of six schools in the Anderson Country School District and one of four elementary schools within the district, with 286 elementary students enrolled in grades pre-k through 6. Additionally, the Anderson County Coroner's Office is currently investigating a death that occurred on Osborne Road, approximately three miles from the school; officials believe the death is related to Wednesday's shooting, as reported by WYFF News 4. According to People, the Anderson County Sheriff's Office has confirmed that the Osborne Road death was a male and a relative of the suspect. A teenage suspect in the Townville school shooting is alive and in custody, according to local police, who has been identified as the lone shooter in the incident; the age and gender of the suspect have not been released. According to Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund, a non-profit gun violence watchdog group, they have recorded 34 school shootings in 2016 alone, occurring in primary and secondary schools and at colleges and universities. Wednesday's shooting at Townville Elementary School invokes some of the same characteristics of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that took place in 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut; since that horrible massacre, Everytown has documented 196 shootings on school campuses. As the nation waits for more information on the victims of the Townville Elementary School shooting, one thing is clear: Gun violence in our schools is a sad and sobering reality for every child in America, no matter where they live. One child has been airlifted to nearby Greenville Trauma Center while the other child and teacher were taken by ambulance to AnMed Health Medical Center in Anderson. Many students were picked up by their parents or guardians at the scene, while remaining students were evacuated from the scene bussed to Oakdale Baptist Church. The rioting broke out after residents learned that the police officer responsible for the killing of Michael Brown would not be charged with any crime. Few of the businesses destroyed in the rioting in Dellwood and nearby Ferguson have reopened. Two police officers were shot Wednesday while standing outside the Ferguson police station observing a protest. Ferguson has faced many violent protests since the August death of Michael Brown."}

Here is the letter in its entirety: Dear Cherry Creek Schools Community: It has happened again. I reach out to you today after another tragic school shooting, this one in Santa Fe, Texas. This is the third school shooting in the U.S. this week, the 22nd school shooting since the beginning of 2018. While our thoughts go out to another grieving community, and while our nation continues to struggle with solutions to school violence, I want to update you on the very specific and important steps we are taking in Cherry Creek Schools to ensure the safest possible learning environments for our students and staff. I have directed our school principals to meet with their School Safety Teams before school begins on Monday, to review their school safety plans and protocols, paying particular attention to the many special events taking place in the final days of the school year, including field days, continuations and graduations. As we do every day, we continue to work with our School Resource Officers and local law enforcement partners. We will have police officers at all of our high school graduation rehearsals and commencement ceremonies. In addition, we are finalizing a recommendation to the Board of Education to further enhance our safety and security measures in the coming school year. Among the initiatives being proposed are: Additional mental health staff, Increased role and enhanced training for school security staff, A middle school entry door buzzer system, similar to those in our elementary schools, Complete the transition from the district Care Line to the Colorado Safe2Tell program so students, parents and community members can continue to report any concerns or threats. Our school counselors and mental health professionals are available to all of our students if they need support in the aftermath of another school shooting. Our mental health team recommends limiting exposure to television and social media coverage of these tragic incidents. Resources about how to talk to children about school violence are available on our website and at this link in multiple languages. Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our students. We will continue to do everything in our power to provide schools where the children of Cherry Creek can learn, grow and thrive in a safe, secure and caring environment. We appreciate your partnership in this all-important effort. Email check failed, please try again Sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email."}

They feel that it also helps feed the school to prison pipeline for whatever reason. But no one seems to mind them when a school resource officer puts an abrupt end to a potential mass shooting. School resource officer Mark Dallas of the Dixon, Ill., police department shot an ex-student at Dixon High School Wednesday morning preventing potential loss of life at the school after the ex-student opened fire on him. The ordeal took place at about 8 a.m. local time when the suspect approached Officer Dallas and opened fire, according to local officials. Dallas then returned fire and hit the suspect. The suspect was then apprehended. He is receiving medical treatment for a non-life-threatening wound. Multiple police agencies are on scene. Parents rushed to the scene to pick up their kids after learning of the attack. They were relieved by the news that none of their children were injured. Johnson said he was grateful Officer Dallas was able to take quick action and protect his children. The action of Officer Dallas, along with the actions of the officer at the Great Mills High School shooting, illustrate just how effective a good guy with a gun can be in preventing something like Parkland. The fact that the school resource officer was apparently a complete and total coward is the only thing that allowed that shooting to go on as long as it did.

The measure was added to state law in light of recent school shootings where armed attackers tripped fire alarms to lure students out of classrooms, making them easy targets. Nineva-Hensley-Jackson Schools Superintendent, Dr. Tim Edsell says his district already has plans to adopt the evacuation option into their safety plan. The evacuation delay option is just the latest safety discussion to address fire alarms in schools. Earlier this year, talk was brewing on social media about getting rid of fire alarm pull stations inside schools. A position statement by the Indiana Fire Chiefs Association said fire chiefs around the state were being asked how to officially and safely remove pull-stations in a school building. Those conversations prompted a message of caution from some fire officials. The law addressing fire evacuation delays leaves room for schools to adopt locally-specific safety plans, and several districts are still working on those. In the event of a fire alarm, Perry Township Schools officials say teachers are being instructed to check hallways before evacuating classrooms, but the district does not plan to officially adopt a three-minute delay. Avon Community School officials declined to release specific details of their safety plans, but district spokesperson Stacy Moore released a statement on the issue. White River Township Fire Chief Jeremy Pell says he and other public safety officials are currently consulting with Center Grove Schools on the matter. His initial reaction to the evacuation delay option is positive. Pell said discussions with Center Grove about the evacuation policy are still ongoing.

As the shooting unfolded Wednesday afternoon behind Townville Elementary School, the teenager, who was not identified because of his age, was taken to the ground by a volunteer firefighter and taken into custody by deputies, authorities said. The father of the suspected shooter was found dead after being shot, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore told reporters. Shore identified him as Jeffrey Osborne, 47, who was found at a house about 2 miles from the school. The teenager called his grandmother at 1:44 p.m. ET, sobbing and speaking unintelligibly, Shore said at a second news conference. The grandparents went to the boy's house next door to check on the father and the boy. The couple found the father but not the boy.

A female teacher was wounded in a shoulder, sheriff's Capt. Garland Major said. It is unclear whether the alleged shooter knew any of the school victims. Major said the motive is unclear, but terrorism has been ruled out. CNN has not determined whether the boy has an attorney. Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said the boy started firing after getting out of his vehicle in the parking lot near the playground. Witnesses told police it appeared the boy was headed toward the school. Several teachers locked doors to prevent him from getting in. School nurses and emergency responders saved the life of the boy who was shot in the leg, said Scott Stoller, the director of EMS in Anderson County. The firefighter, Jamie Brock, declined to meet with the media, but Stoller said the man said he did nothing any other firefighter wouldn't have done. The teacher and one student taken to AnMed Health Center were released Wednesday evening, hospital spokesman Ross Norton told CNN. The other child was taken to Greenville Health System emergency trauma center by helicopter, spokeswoman Sandy Dees said. Dees told CNN on Wednesday night that student was in critical condition. The mother of a student at Townville Elementary School told CNN Greenville affiliate WYFF that her daughter and classmates huddled in a bathroom. I know all the kids were scared. ...

The teen is accused of killing his father and wounding three people during the school shooting. He has been charged as a juvenile with murder and three counts of attempted murder. The 14 year old appeared in juvenile court on Friday wearing a yellow jail jumpsuit without any restraints. A judge ordered him to continue to be held. On Thursday, firefighters recounted the harrowing scene at the school, in a quiet community near the Georgia line. When two volunteer firefighters rolled up to the school, they said they found only a wrecked black pickup truck at the playground. There was no gunman and no one inside the truck. Within minutes, though, it was clear something awful had happened. One went inside to help treat the wounded and the other searched for the shooter, and neighbors are now calling them heroes. Authorities say the teen, who hasn't been identified because of his age, shot his father, 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne, at their home before driving the pickup 3 miles down a country road lined with chicken houses and pine trees to Townville Elementary. He only had to make two turns to arrive at the red brick school, where he crashed the truck, got out and fired at a door as it was being opened for recess, authorities said. Bullets struck two students and a first-grade teacher, and the building was immediately placed on lock down. The shooter then fired toward students on the playground but missed. A teacher who heard the first gunshot was able to get those students safely inside, Avery said. Relatives of one of the wounded, 6-year-old Jacob Hall, said he remained on life support in a hospital. His family issued a statement late Thursday saying the boy sustained a major brain injury due to the amount of blood he lost after being shot in the leg. The shot teacher and another student who was hit in the foot were treated and released from a hospital, officials said. RELATED: Townville Elementary parents assured of student safety Classes are scheduled to resume at the school Monday, but second-grader Mattie LeCroy doesn't want to go. The violence was a punch in the gut to people around Townville, where residents say some families have lived on the same land since before the Civil War. Authorities said they don't yet know a motive for the shooting and they were not sure if the students and teacher were targeted or shot randomly. Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said the teen had been homeschooled, but the reason isn't clear. The fire chief said he and firefighter Jamie Brock were working on his farm when they got the call about an active shooter at Townville Elementary. They rushed to the school and found the empty pickup. Teachers told them there were wounded inside, and Brock suggested to the fire chief that he go inside to help because he was a paramedic. Alongside a school nurse, the chief attended to Jacob, who was the most seriously injured. In the meantime, law enforcement swarmed the school and Brock looked for the shooter, finding him near the back of the school building. She was at work at the time of the shooting, the sheriff said. Both Tiffney and Jeffrey Osborne's first marriages ended in divorce before they got married. They each had children, who are now adults, with their exes. Authorities said audio from the 911 calls will not be released while the investigation is ongoing. More Stories Copyright 2018 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.

Investigators offered no immediate motive for the shooting. The governor said the assailant intended to kill himself but gave up and told police that he did not have the courage to take his own life. The deaths were all but certain to re-ignite the national debate over gun regulations, coming just three months after the Parkland, Florida, attack that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I wasn't surprised. Another 10 people were wounded at the school in Santa Fe, a city of about 13,000 people roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Houston, the governor said. The wounded included a school police officer who was the first to confront the suspect and got shot in the arm. Hospitals reported treating a total of 14 people for injuries related to the shooting. Zachary Muehe, a sophomore, was in his art class when he heard three loud booms. I remember seeing the shrapnel from the tables, whatever he hit. Michael Farina, 17, said he was on the other side of campus when the shooting began. He heard a fire alarm and thought it was a drill. He was holding a door open for special education students in wheelchairs when a principal came bounding down the hall and telling everyone to run. Some still did not feel safe and began jumping the fence behind the shop to run even farther away, Farina said. The suspect was identified as Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who appeared to have no prior arrests or confrontations with law enforcement. A woman who answered the phone at a number associated with the Pagourtzis family declined to speak with the AP. Pagourtzis made his initial court appearance Friday evening by video link from the Galveston County Jail. A judge denied bond and took his application for a court-appointed attorney. McCaul, a former federal prosecutor, said he expects the Justice Department to pursue additional charges, possibly involving weapons of mass destruction. Pagourtzis played on the junior varsity football team and was a member of a dance squad with a local Greek Orthodox church. Acquaintances described him as quiet and unassuming, an avid video game player who routinely wore a black trench coat and black boots to class. handgun from his father, who owned them legally, Abbott said. It was not clear whether the father knew his son had taken them. Investigators were determining whether the shotgun's shortened barrel was legal, Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. The assailant's homemade explosives included pipe bombs, at least one Molotov cocktail and pressure-cooker bombs similar to those used in the Boston Marathon attack, authorities said. While cable news channels carried hours of live coverage, survivors of the Feb. 14 Florida attack took to social media to express grief and outrage. It's an all too familiar feeling no one should have to experience. This is the 22nd school shooting just this year. In Texas, senior Logan Roberds said he was near the school's art room when he heard the fire alarm and left the building with other students. Once outside, Roberds said, he heard two loud bangs. He initially thought somebody was loudly hitting a trash can. Then came three more bangs. Roberds said additional gun-control measures are not needed, citing the need for defense against intruders. Friday's assault was the deadliest in Texas since a man with a semi-automatic rifle attacked a rural church late last year, killing more than two dozen people. There were few prior clues about Pagourtzis' behavior, unlike the shootings in Parkland and the church in Sutherland Springs, Abbott said, but the teen wrote in journals of wanting to carry out such an attack and then to end his own life. In the aftermath of the Florida assault, survivors pulled all-nighters, petitioned city councils and state lawmakers, and organized protests in a grass-roots movement. Within weeks, state lawmakers adopted changes, including new weapons restrictions. In late March, the teens spearheaded one of the largest student protest marches since Vietnam in Washington and inspired hundreds of other marches from California to Japan. Texas has some of the most permissive gun laws in the U.S. and just hosted the NRA's annual conference earlier this month. In the run-up to the March primary election, gun control was not a main issue with candidates of either party. Republicans did not soften their views on guns, and Democrats campaigned on a range of issues instead of zeroing in on gun violence. AlertMe Trademark and Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

As of 12:30 p.m. ET, this is what we know: CASUALTIES At least eight people and as many as 10 have died, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. Most of the dead are students, the sheriff said. At least 12 people have been hospitalized. Details on the conditions of the patients was not immediately available. At least one police officer was injured, Gonzalez said. There could be additional injured that law enforcement has not found yet, Gonzalez said. THE SUSPECT A male suspect, believed to be a student in his teens, has been arrested according to the Sheriff. A second person, also believed to be a student, has been detained as well, Gonzalez said. An armed person walked into an art class at the school and began firing what looked like a shotgun, a witness told CNN affiliate KTRK. The bomb unit is searching for explosives in the school but Gonzalez would not confirm if any have been found. The entire school district is on lockdown, district officials said. Republican Rep. Randy Weber, who represents the district where the shooting took place, just tweeted that his office was monitoring the situation. The high school has about 1,400 students, according to GreatSchools.org. Santa Fe is a city of about 13,000 people roughly 20 miles northwest of Galveston and 30 miles southeast of Houston.

As the shooting unfolded Wednesday afternoon behind Townville Elementary School, the teenager, who was not identified because of his age, was taken to the ground by a volunteer firefighter and taken into custody by deputies, authorities said. The father of the suspected shooter was found dead after being shot, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore told reporters. Shore identified him as Jeffrey Osborne, 47, who was found at a house about 2 miles from the school. The teenager called his grandmother at 1:44 p.m. ET, sobbing and speaking unintelligibly, Shore said at a second news conference. The couple found the father but not the boy. About 1:45 p.m., a teacher at the school called 911 to report a shooting. One male student was critically injured with a gunshot to the leg and another boy was struck in a foot. Garland Major said. It is unclear whether the alleged shooter knew any of the school victims. Major said the motive is unclear, but terrorism has been ruled out. CNN has not determined whether the boy has an attorney. Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said the boy started firing after getting out of his vehicle in the parking lot near the playground. Witnesses told police it appeared the boy was headed toward the school. Several teachers locked doors to prevent him from getting in. School nurses and emergency responders saved the life of the boy who was shot in the leg, said Scott Stoller, the director of EMS in Anderson County. The teacher and one student taken to AnMed Health Center were released Wednesday evening, hospital spokesman Ross Norton told CNN. The other child was taken to Greenville Health System emergency trauma center by helicopter, spokeswoman Sandy Dees said. Dees told CNN on Wednesday night that student was in critical condition. The mother of a student at Townville Elementary School told CNN Greenville affiliate WYFF that her daughter and classmates huddled in a bathroom. I know all the kids were scared. The mother said she was praying for the families of the injured. The shooting occurred about 1:45 p.m. ET, officials said. Townville is in the extreme western part of the state, southwest of Greenville and near the Georgia line. Anderson County has a population of about 194,692. The elementary school has about 280 students. School has been canceled for the rest of the week. Joanne Avery, superintendent of Anderson County School District 4, told the media that school personnel have participated in active-shooter training and she said that training kept the incident from being much worse. Gov. Nikki Haley said she would make sure law enforcement would have the resources it needed as investigators do their work.

Schachter has created a non-profit group, Safe Schools For Alex (SafeSchoolsForAlex.org) to try to find solutions. Scott TravisContact ReporterSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Max Schachter believes his son Alex could have survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High massacre if only the school had been equipped with the security features found in an Indiana high school. Stoneman Douglas, on the other hand, struggled with a fire alarm system that activated during the Feb. 14 mass shooting and caused confusion, a surveillance system that misled cops when it was monitored on a time delay, and windows that offered no protection from an AR-15 style rifle. Many believe that those problems, as well as a school police officer who failed to confront the killer, contributed to the murders of 17 students and employees. From the terror, tears and trauma, a movement for change was born. Parkland students are leading the March for Our Lives in Washington,... Last week, Schachter toured Southwestern High with a group that included Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie, School Board member Abby Freedman, Sheriff Scott Israel and Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter, Alyssa, was killed at Stoneman Douglas. Dispatchers can automatically locate where in the building the shooter is. -- Teachers wear panic buttons as fobs that alert administrators and police of a crisis. -- Classroom doors automatically lock in an active shooter situation. -- Red lines of tape in each classroom mark where students and staff can stay behind to avoid being visible to those looking through the window. -- A box on the wall allows a teacher to mark the class as safe or in danger. -- Smoke cannons produce a smoke-like substance that encompasses the hallways, making it difficult for a killer to see anything. Runcie said he was impressed by much of what he saw, particularly the bulletproof windows and doors. The group discovered that NetTalon, a Virginia-based company, had created the virtual command technology they were looking for, according to media reports. The security system, installed in 2014, brought national media attention to the school. Officials with the school declined to comment. But Don Jones, CEO of NetTalon, said six other schools in Indiana are planning to duplicate the features at Southwestern. One major challenge the Broward school district faces in enacting these measures is money. But the pricetag is likely more than that, since Southwestern is a small 300-student school with one building. Most Broward schools are much larger. Stoneman Douglas, for example, has 3,200 students and 14 buildings. Schachter has created a non-profit group, Safe Schools For Alex (SafeSchoolsForAlex.org) to try to find solutions. On Wednesday, he will meet in with Nelson, Rubio and other federal officials at a national safe schools forum in Washington, D.C. Schachter said only one vendor currently provides the safety features found in the Indiana school, but if they became standard, it would attract more competition and bring the prices down. And Schachter said his group may look for small increases to property taxes to help pay for improvements."}

The law requires every school to have at least one armed person on campus. In this June 11 news report, Broward County schools plan adding armed security guards to schools. The law requires every school to have at least one armed person on campus. Scott TravisContact ReporterSun Sentinel Privacy Policy Armed security guards are likely to be added at Broward County schools this fall in order to meet requirements of a new state law. The law requires every school to have at least one armed person on campus. Most would work in elementary schools. Several board members say they would prefer to only hire retired police officers or military veterans. State law previously authorized only sworn law enforcement to carry guns. Most classroom teachers would be ineligible, but districts can arm administrators, coaches, librarians, ROTC instructors and security personnel. On paper, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High looked like one of the safest high schools in Florida. The Broward school district reported to the state that no one was bullied or harassed, no one trespassed on campus, no one was violently attacked, no one broke into campus after hours and nothing expensive... The Broward School Board voted in April not to participate in the program, saying it wanted only sworn police officers. The School Board plans to vote later this month to rescind that. Other school districts, such as Pinellas County, are using their school resource officer allocations to hire people to serve specifically as guardians. Under a similar plan, the Broward school district would not arm existing employees. Another potential problem is insurance. Others, including Hollywood, Plantation and Pompano Beach, pay for one officer for two or three elementary schools. School district officials would prefer for city governments to continue subsidizing the costs of the additional officers needed to comply with the law. But even if they do, the county faces a shortage of about 300 police officers and may not be able fill all the positions, Moquin said. They were students, they were teachers. Athletes, dancers, coaches, musicians. The 17 who were lost in the senseless shooting on February 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, leave behind heartbroken family, friends, classmates and communities. These are their faces... Gualtieri, who heads a commission investigating the Stoneman Douglas tragedy, said the state law is not optional, and he gave an ominous warning Friday to any school board members and administrators who plan to start school this August without a police officer or armed guardian. Go home. Whether Broward schools can create the guardian positions, hire employees and train them in time for the start of school remains to be seen."}

Kids know that they will be caught if they carry guns into the school, especially into the classroom. They depend on the natural chaos that occurs during lunch periods or fire drills to mask their intentions to kill other students. The problem is that schools are preparing for the last threat. They are training to lock down classrooms in response to a school shooting. Please read it in full. Just as generals always prepare to fight the last war, it appears that the vast majority of school safety plans are geared towards combatting the last perceived major incident, something like the December, 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre of children in their classrooms. NONE of the seven active shooter incidents on elementary and high school campuses since Sandy Hook fit that profile. As parents and school safety advocates, we need to push our school districts to put plans in place for the more common emerging threats, which incidents that occur in large common areas such as cafeterias and libraries. We also need to have administrators develop plans and action drills so that faculty, staff, and students know what to do when an incident happens before and after school.

The 13-year-old suspect, who FOX59 is not identifying because he is a juvenile, showed little to no emotion as his two parents stood next to him in court. Science teacher Jason Seaman, who's credited with stopping the shooting and was shot three times, was among those inside the courtroom. A classmate of Ella Whistler, the other person injured in the May 25 shooting, also attended the hearing. The judge read the 11 charges the 13-year-old would face if he'd been charged as an adult: two counts each of attempted murder, aggravated battery, battery by means of a deadly weapon, possession of a firearm on school property and dangerous possession of a firearm. He's also charged with possession of a knife on school property. The majority of Monday's hearing focused on the charges against the teen and what legal options the shooting suspect will have in the future. He can't be charged as an adult because, under current state law, a child 13 years of age can only be waived to adult court if the attempt to murder an individual is successful. caliber gun and a knife at the time of the attack.

{"URL_s":"https://wtkr.com/2018/08/15/its-back-to-school-in-parkland-but-hardly-back-to-normal","Timestamp_s":"20180819063458","Sentences_t":"In any other place, in any other new school year, things would be as they were. But when your school is also the site of one of the deadliest school shootings in American history, nothing is ever really normal. There are other changes, too. There are now two principals at MSD, because the basic demands of running a school are now joined by the demands of managing a community in crisis. There are some new gates at certain entry points, a smattering of new portable classrooms; nothing too out of the ordinary. Until then, it stands there like a mausoleum, empty and silent. If Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were like any other school, the collective nerves of returning students and staff would be predictable responses to a new year, not the complex expectations and questions of survivors returning to a crime scene. Security concerns, and controversies, loom Kai Koerber is one of the roughly 3,100 MSD students returning to school today. He has high hopes that, while nothing can really be normal again, he and his fellow students will find some optimism. Koerber is dismayed that the school decided not to install metal detectors, one of several proposed security measures considered over the summer. Ultimately, the school shelved the idea until it could train staff on how to properly use them. It also discontinued the requirement of clear backpacks; a measure from last school year that prompted privacy concerns and dark-humored ridicule. However, students will notice other changes. There are 52 new security cameras on campus, a new intercom system, and new door lock systems and four additional security personnel. But the day 19-year-old Nikolas Cruzbarged into his former school with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, they were pulled through a prism of identities: They became survivors, advocates, activists, leaders, mourners, celebrities, political figures and pariahs. Seventeen became victims, whose memories serve as the bedrock of so many movements of love and change. Looming over all of this, the school and the community of Parkland have become icons of the complex problem of gun violence in America. Some students are hoping a new school year will bring some much-needed balance. For many others returning to MSD, a public life of activism and leadership is now business as usual. Over the summer, Koerber attended a leadership summit in New Zealand, spoke at a Business Insider panel in Cannes and interned in Washington, DC with his congressman, Ted Deutch. Kyle Kashuv, another MSD survivor and rising senior, met with President Donald Trump over the summer and has become a regular commentator on conservative media outlets. For students like Koerber and Kashuv, who are trying to balance their lives as both students and newly minted agents of change, the constant attention is a price they are willing to pay for the cause. Political fabric is rewoven If Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were like any other school, the upcoming Broward County school board elections would be another unremarkable piece of local politics. Instead, they will be a referendum, a moment of truth for a community still reeling with grief and anger. Mourning parents have taken up the political mantle here, hungry for accountability from officials they say failed the students of MSD. Stand with Parkland, a group formed by families of the victims, condemned the Broward County School Board earlier this month, saying the board was indecisive in implementing security measures and in following up on independent investigations. On August 28, five of the nine embattled members of the Broward County School Board are up for re-election. Among those looking to take their seats are Lori Alhadeff and Ryan Petty. It changed everything around them. The ripples it set off have become waves, far across the country and as close as the nearest Parkland voting booth. As the school years go by, everyday details of hallways and fences and coaches and classes will fade back into a comforting monotony. And as long as what happened there continues to matter, it never will be. Trademark and Copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

{"URL_s":"https://kfor.com/2018/08/13/luther-schools-arming-classroom-personnel","Timestamp_s":"20180819063423","Sentences_t":"The school board voted to approve the policy in June, effective this year. Superintendent Barry Gunn said the controversial decision was based on doing everything possible to protect their students. Gunn declined to go on camera for the story but said, in an interview, he would hand-pick about two people to be armed in each school. After nearly 20 years in the school district, he said he would make the decision based on his knowledge of how the person reacts in a high-pressure situation. The policy not only requires the people chosen have a conceal carry license but about 110 hours of training as well, including security guard training and active shooter training. The firearm must be kept in a locked and secured location, or carried in an approved holster on his or her person. Gunn stressed it could not be at all visible. The identity of the armed personnel is to be kept secret from students and parents, and revealing that information could result in termination. Not everyone is thrilled about the policy, including Luther mother Julie Moore. She has five children in Luther Public Schools and said she doesn't believe introducing more guns to the classroom is the solution to school shootings. Gun-safety advocate Audrey Burro with 'Moms Demand Action' insists arming school staff just puts children at risk. But, Gunn argued it's the school board's decision to make school policy and it must do everything possible to keep their children safe, even if it's controversial.

Fireman Jamie Brock (R) saved lives including Jacob's. (Sep. (Sep. (Sep. TOWNVILLE, SC (FOX Carolina) - The Solicitor's Office announced new charges in the case against a teenager accused of opening fire on the campus of an Upstate elementary school. School has been canceled until Thursday, Oct. 6 at Townville Elementary School after deputies said a 14-year-old suspect opened fire on the school playground, wounding three people on Wednesday. One of the victims, Jacob Hall, passed away on Saturday. VICTIMS WOUNDED, CHILD KILLED Deputies said two boys, both first grade students at the school, and an adult teacher were shot on the playground behind the school, located on Townville School Road. Jacob, one of the students, was airlifted to the Greenville Hospital System pediatric trauma unit after being shot in the leg. During a press conference on Thursday, relatives said Jacob suffered massive blood loss and was on life support, too weak currently for additional surgeries. On Saturday afternoon, Jacob passed away. Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said the boy passes away just before 1 p.m. at Greenville Memorial Hospital. The other student, who was shot in the foot, and the teacher, shot in the shoulder, were taken to AnMed Health System for treatment. As of 6 p.m. officials at AnMed said both were released from the hospital. The teacher was later identified as first-grade teacher Meghan Hollingsworth. According to Townville Elementary School, she has been teaching for 13 years. She joined the school in 2007. On Monday, Solicitor Chrissy Adams said a third child victim was identified. Anderson County deputies released a statement about the newly identified victim on Tuesday. The spokesman for the family, who asked to remain anonymous, said the boy was a good student, had a good relationship with his parents and the family is in shock by what happened. The suspect is currently being held at the Greenville County Detention Center. He appeared in court on Friday and was charged as a juvenile. On Monday, solicitor Adams said one of the attempted murder counts was official upgraded to a murder charge after the death of Jacob Hall. Additional petitions were filed for five counts of possession of a weapon during a violent crime. The suspect is facing a total of two counts of murder, three counts of attempted murder and five counts of the weapons charge. On Oct. 6, the Solicitor's Office filed a motion petitioning the court to try the teen suspect as an adult. A hearing will be set by a Family Court judge. The suspect reportedly drove a Dodge Ram onto the school property and jumped a fence to access the playground. He never entered the school, according to officials. Taylor Jones, Anderson County Emergency Services Director, said the shooting was reported by a teacher who called 911 from a classroom at 1:45 p.m. Eli Stephens, a Townville Elementary student, said they could hear shots in his classroom. A parent of one Townville Elementary student said her son has been having nightmares and is afraid to go back to school. She said he will likely get counseling as he copes with the events. It was an emotional scene on Wednesday as parents were reunited with their children after the school evacuation. The firefighter was identified as Jamie Brock, who has served the community for 30 years. Brock released a statement via the Townville fire chief on Thursday, saying his reaction to put his life on the line was no different than any other fire or law enforcement personnel. He said the true heroes are the teachers and principal who protected Townville Elementary's students. Dr. Joanne Avery, Anderson County District 4 Superintendent, said staff had undergone active shooter training and, along with first responders, put that training into action. Students and staff were evacuated from the school as deputies and SWAT team members were evacuated from the school and the students were transported by bus to Oakdale Baptist Church on nearby Highway 24. Parents picked up their children at the church, which was protected by armed deputies. Coroner Greg Shore confirmed during a press conference 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne was found with gunshot wounds and his death has been ruled a homicide. The suspect is charged with murder in connection with his father's death.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Survivor: Guns are weapons, not toys 04:44 Story highlights Shooter identified Mason, 12, shot in abdomen outside Sparks Middle School in Nevada on Monday Mason was one of two students injured; a teacher was killed Mason says he tried to help teacher before he was wounded himself Mason heard gunshots while he was outside with classmates, waiting for school to start. Then students were running, and a teacher was lying still on a playground basketball court, hit by gunfire. The 12-year-old wanted to help him, but a vice principal told him to run. So Mason moved toward the building -- and that's when he saw Jose Reyes, a friend and a Sparks Middle School classmate, with a gun about 10 to 20 feet away. Authorities say Mason was the last of three people that Reyes, 12, shot with a 9 mm handgun Monday morning outside the school. Mason and another wounded student -- the first to be shot -- survived. Math teacher Mike Landsberry, the second to be hit, died. Investigators say Landsberry probably saved lives by walking toward the shooter -- giving others time to flee -- on the basketball court after the first student was shot in the shoulder. A student opened fire at the middle school, police said, killing a teacher and wounding two students. Authorities said it was too soon to say whether the suspect was killed by a self-inflicted wound or by law enforcement. School has been canceled for the week at both the elementary and middle schools, officials said. James Ross supervised slain teacher Michael Landsberry in the National Guard. Victim's brother: He loved teaching 02:21 Reyes fatally shot himself, police said. Sgt. Greta Woyciehowsky of the Sparks Police Department and Adam Mayberry, a spokesman for the city of Sparks, confirmed Reyes was the shooter. Mason, shot in the abdomen, was able to walk at the hospital Thursday. Now Mason is left wondering what caused his friend to hurt him and a classmate, and kill a teacher that Mason deeply admired. Slain Nevada teacher Michael Landsberry calmly gave others time to escape The shooting Mason said the incident began when he heard a few gunshots -- he thought they were in the distance -- as children gathered outside the school after 7 a.m., waiting for the day to begin. At first confused about why schoolmates were running, he saw Landsberry lying wounded on the basketball court. A friend called 911. Mason and other students wanted to get Landsberry into the school, he said. Reyes -- a friend Mason had met at the start of the school year -- said nothing as he shot him, Mason recalled. When Mason was shot, he said, he felt a sharp pain in the abdomen and ran from the shooter. He soon saw a security guard, who told him to lie down and put pressure on his wound, Mason said. The shooter Authorities haven't said why they believe Reyes opened fire. Mason said he wasn't aware of any bullying. He said the shooter was nice, but sometimes started arguments with people he disagreed with. Mason said he doesn't believe Reyes sought him out or the other wounded student during the shooting. Davis, Mason's mother, told CNN that she grieves for the shooter's family. Teacher was 'good all-around' guy 'Keep these guns out of kids' hands' Reyes took his parents' handgun to school, a federal law enforcement source said. Sparks Deputy Police Chief Tom Miller said Tuesday that authorities weren't positive where the gun came from, but believe it belonged to the boy's parents. The Nevada shooting comes almost a year after a gunman killed 26 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, igniting a nationwide debate over gun violence and school safety. Since the Newtown shootings last December, proposed school security plans across the country have included arming teachers, adding armed security guards and bringing in bulletproof backpacks and white boards. Teacher slayings hurt view of schools as safe havens Landsberry 'fun to hang around' Landsberry was an Alabama native who graduated from high school in Reno, next door to Sparks, in 1986. After a stint in the Marine Corps, he got an education degree from the University of Nevada in Reno. He joined the Air National Guard in 2001, rising to the rank of master sergeant and serving as a cargo specialist in Kuwait and Afghanistan, the Guard said. Mason said Landsberry was never his teacher, but losing him is hard. Davis said she hoped the hospital would release Mason later Thursday or Friday. She said she and her son will have a conversation about when -- and whether -- he will return to the school. ... Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved. .d8888b."}

Investigators offered no immediate motive for the shooting. The governor said the assailant intended to kill himself but gave up and told police that he did not have the courage to take his own life. The deaths were all but certain to re-ignite the national debate over gun regulations, coming just three months after the Parkland, Florida, attack that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. I wasn't surprised. Another 10 people were wounded at the school in Santa Fe, a city of about 13,000 people roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Houston, the governor said. The wounded included a school police officer who was the first to confront the suspect and got shot in the arm. Hospitals reported treating a total of 14 people for injuries related to the shooting. Zachary Muehe, a sophomore, was in his art class when he heard three loud booms. I remember seeing the shrapnel from the tables, whatever he hit. Michael Farina, 17, said he was on the other side of campus when the shooting began. He heard a fire alarm and thought it was a drill. He was holding a door open for special education students in wheelchairs when a principal came bounding down the hall and telling everyone to run. Some still did not feel safe and began jumping the fence behind the shop to run even farther away, Farina said. The suspect was identified as Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who appeared to have no prior arrests or confrontations with law enforcement. A woman who answered the phone at a number associated with the Pagourtzis family declined to speak with the AP. Pagourtzis made his initial court appearance Friday evening by video link from the Galveston County Jail. A judge denied bond and took his application for a court-appointed attorney. McCaul, a former federal prosecutor, said he expects the Justice Department to pursue additional charges, possibly involving weapons of mass destruction. Pagourtzis played on the junior varsity football team and was a member of a dance squad with a local Greek Orthodox church. Acquaintances described him as quiet and unassuming, an avid video game player who routinely wore a black trench coat and black boots to class. handgun from his father, who owned them legally, Abbott said. It was not clear whether the father knew his son had taken them. Investigators were determining whether the shotgun's shortened barrel was legal, Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. The assailant's homemade explosives included pipe bombs, at least one Molotov cocktail and pressure-cooker bombs similar to those used in the Boston Marathon attack, authorities said. While cable news channels carried hours of live coverage, survivors of the Feb. 14 Florida attack took to social media to express grief and outrage. It's an all too familiar feeling no one should have to experience. This is the 22nd school shooting just this year. In Texas, senior Logan Roberds said he was near the school's art room when he heard the fire alarm and left the building with other students. Once outside, Roberds said, he heard two loud bangs. He initially thought somebody was loudly hitting a trash can. Then came three more bangs. Roberds said additional gun-control measures are not needed, citing the need for defense against intruders. Friday's assault was the deadliest in Texas since a man with a semi-automatic rifle attacked a rural church late last year, killing more than two dozen people. There were few prior clues about Pagourtzis' behavior, unlike the shootings in Parkland and the church in Sutherland Springs, Abbott said, but the teen wrote in journals of wanting to carry out such an attack and then to end his own life. In the aftermath of the Florida assault, survivors pulled all-nighters, petitioned city councils and state lawmakers, and organized protests in a grass-roots movement. Within weeks, state lawmakers adopted changes, including new weapons restrictions. In late March, the teens spearheaded one of the largest student protest marches since Vietnam in Washington and inspired hundreds of other marches from California to Japan. Texas has some of the most permissive gun laws in the U.S. and just hosted the NRA's annual conference earlier this month. In the run-up to the March primary election, gun control was not a main issue with candidates of either party. Republicans did not soften their views on guns, and Democrats campaigned on a range of issues instead of zeroing in on gun violence. AlertMe Trademark and Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

More recommendations may follow. A local parent group called S.O.S (Saving Our Students) Noblesville had been pushing for officials to ditch the problematic practice. The school district unveiled the recommendations at the first school board meeting Tuesday night since the shooting, after hero teacher Jason Seaman and other NWMS staff were honored with a standing ovation. The school safety coordinator said during his presentation they were also researching metal detectors and classroom barricading products, and recommending there be a full time school safety director. More than a dozen parents and community members also spoke during the meeting. Some expressed gratitude for the response, specifically to Mr. Seaman, while others raised their own concerns and ideas to improve safety. Noblesville Schools says funding is already in place for some of the initial safety enhancements. The school corporation is also exploring other funding options through state and federal resources and may ask the community to support a referendum this November to provide additional funding for safety initiatives and teacher compensation.

The measure was added to state law in light of recent school shootings where armed attackers tripped fire alarms to lure students out of classrooms, making them easy targets. Nineva-Hensley-Jackson Schools Superintendent, Dr. Tim Edsell says his district already has plans to adopt the evacuation option into their safety plan. The evacuation delay option is just the latest safety discussion to address fire alarms in schools. Earlier this year, talk was brewing on social media about getting rid of fire alarm pull stations inside schools. A position statement by the Indiana Fire Chiefs Association said fire chiefs around the state were being asked how to officially and safely remove pull-stations in a school building. Those conversations prompted a message of caution from some fire officials. The law addressing fire evacuation delays leaves room for schools to adopt locally-specific safety plans, and several districts are still working on those. In the event of a fire alarm, Perry Township Schools officials say teachers are being instructed to check hallways before evacuating classrooms, but the district does not plan to officially adopt a three-minute delay. Avon Community School officials declined to release specific details of their safety plans, but district spokesperson Stacy Moore released a statement on the issue. White River Township Fire Chief Jeremy Pell says he and other public safety officials are currently consulting with Center Grove Schools on the matter. His initial reaction to the evacuation delay option is positive. Pell said discussions with Center Grove about the evacuation policy are still ongoing.

Henry denied bail for the student, who is accused of capital murder of multiple people and aggravated assault on a public servant. Nine students and one teacher were killed, a law enforcement official told CNN. She did not identify the student who was shot. Quintanilla also says the suspect fired in her direction as she tried to run out of the room. She says the bullet ricocheted and hit her right leg. She was still wearing a hospital bracelet on her wrist as she spoke after a Friday night vigil. He was not asked to enter a plea. The probable cause affidavit says he told an investigator he spared people he liked because he wanted his story told. Friends and family attend a vigil held at the First Bank in Santa Fe for the victims of a shooting incident at Santa Fe High School where a shooter killed at least 10 students on May 18, 2018 in Santa Fe, Texas. At least 10 people were killed when a gunman opened fire at Santa Fe High school. Police arrested a student suspect and detained a second person. Rome Shubert showed CNN affiliate KTRK where a bullet went in the back of his head and came out near his left ear. The officer was working as a Santa Fe officer, a police union official tweeted. Early morning attack Gunfire erupted at the school, about 20 miles outside Galveston, not long after classes began around 7:30 a.m. CT, officials said. Authorities later found explosive devices -- including pipe bombs and pressure cookers -- in and near the school, the law enforcement official said. A second person -- also believed to be a student -- has been detained as well, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said earlier. This is the 22nd US school shooting since the beginning of the year, and the third instance in eight days in which a gunman was on a school campus. Witnesses described students running from the school as they heard gunshots; they also described hearing an alarm at the school, though the sequence of events wasn't immediately clear. Authorities found explosive devices in the high school and in adjacent areas, said Walter Braun, Santa Fe Independent School District police chief. It wasn't immediately clear if any had exploded. Investigators Friday afternoon were searching a trailer where they believe the devices were assembled, a law enforcement source said. Witness: Shooter fired gun in an art class Daymon Rabon was in class when he heard a loud bang next door. Rabon said he followed his teacher, who went to investigate. They heard three more bangs and saw the shooter come out off of an art room. They went back into their classroom and told others to help barricade the door. Rabon said he heard more than a dozen shots. Rabon said he heard someone shooting back and they gave them some hope, but the shooting seemed right outside their door. Victims were being treated at three hospitals, authorities said. Eight people went to Clear Lake Regional Medical in Webster, Texas; two patients were treated at Mainland Medical Center in Texas City; and four patients went to John Sealy University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. It is unclear whether they were all wounded or some were treated for other injuries. Six of the eight patients at Clear Lake Regional were discharged by Friday afternoon. A witness who spoke to KTRK also said she heard an alarm. She didn't specify if that was before or after the gunfire she described in the art class. She said she couldn't describe the shooter. Another student, Dakota Shrader, told CNN affiliate KPRC that she heard gunshots only after hearing an alarm in the school. The high school has about 1,400 students, according to GreatSchools.org.

The father of a missing Georgia boy was training children at a New Mexico compound to commit school shootings, prosecutors said in court documents obtained Wednesday, as authorities waited to learn if human remains found at the site were those of the boy. The documents say Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was conducting weapons training with assault rifles at the compound near the Colorado border where authorities say they found 11 hungry children living in filthy conditions in a raid Friday. Prosecutor Timothy Hasson filed the court documents while asking that Wahhaj be held without bail after he was arrested last week with four other adults facing child abuse charges. Prosecutors did not bring up the school shooting accusation in court on Wednesday during an initial appearance by the abuse suspects. A judge ordered Wahhaj held without bond pending further proceedings. In the court documents, authorities said a foster parent of one of the 11 children removed from the compound had told authorities that the child had been trained to use an assault rifle in preparation for a school shooting.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott ordered government flags flown at half-staff through Monday in honor of victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a public school of some 3,000 students outside Boca Raton. The school is closed for the rest of the week, Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said. The district will offer grief counseling to students and their families. Anxious family members await news of their loved ones. The suspect, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, was expelled for unspecified disciplinary reasons, Runcie said. He is due in court Thursday. Read More The shooting, which is among the 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern US history, revived debate over gun control while American politicians offered their condolences. Messages from the scene in texts and Snapchats Law enforcement responded to reports of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shortly before 3 p.m. and encountered a chaotic scene. Investigators believe the suspect pulled the fire alarm to draw people out of classrooms and increase the number of casualties, a law enforcement source told CNN. But the school already had a fire drill earlier in the day, leading some to think it was a false alarm. Students evacuate the school. While some left the building, others sought cover in classrooms as the school went into lockdown and the gunman went on his rampage. Some students, fearing their lives would soon be over, texted goodbyes to loved ones; others used their phones to share startling footage of the carnage on social media. Video shows students hiding as shots are fired 00:39 One teacher said she was on her way out of the building after the fire alarm when another staff member told her the situation was code red -- an active shooter. Melissa Falkowski returned to a classroom and hid in a closet with 19 students from her newspaper class for nearly 40 minutes. Falkowski credited the fire drill and recent active shooter training with saving lives. And yet, it didn't save enough. Broward County Schools has prepared us for this situation and still to have so many casualties, at least for me, it's very emotional.

Freshman Kayden Hanafi said he heard two gunshots and saw people running out of another building on campus. As he and his classmates went into lockdown, many thought the noise might have been firecrackers. The fire alarm blared. Then the gunshots began and students ran for their lives Nicole Baltzer, 18, said she was in trigonometry class about 10 minutes before the end of the school day when the fire alarm went off. As students evacuated, she heard six gunshots and everyone started running back inside the school, Baltzer said. A freshman named Aidan posted a photo on social media from inside his math class while on lockdown. The scene inside a classroom at the school. Terror in Florida's safest city The shooting sent students and staff streaming out of the school. Some walked calmly with their hands up while others ran. According to a law enforcement source, the suspect initially mixed in with the crowd of students to try to get away, but it didn't work. Immediately after the shooting, aerial footage from CNN affiliate WSVN showed people lying on the ground outside the school, being treated for injuries and moved to ambulances. Seventeen people, including the suspect, were sent to area hospitals, said Dr. Evan Boyar of Broward Health. As news of the shooting spread, desperate parents gathered near the property, searching for their children at the nearby Walmart where the students and staff gathered after being evacuated. Those who died included students and adults, the sheriff said. Twelve were killed inside the building and two died outside, he said. One died in the street and two died at the hospital, Israel said. Parkland, with a population of 31,000 in 2016, was named Florida's safest city last year, according to one analysis. The south Florida city had seven reported violent crimes and 186 property crimes the previous year, the analysis said. CNN has not confirmed the number of injured.

News-Press Published 10:35 a.m. ET Jan. 8, 2013 A man is shot dead in the parking lot of Christian school in Fort Myers' first homicide of the year. A faculty member at the Apostolic Revival Center Christian School in Fort Myers, Fla., walks a student away from the main school building after police found a man shot dead in the school's parking lot Monday. Fort Myers' first homicide of 2013 was being committed just yards away from the Apostolic Revival Center and Christian School. Fort Myers Police Chief Doug Baker arrived at the crime scene expressing frustration about the brazen nature of this homicide and the neighbors who continue to protect violent criminals from police. The school was closed Tuesday because of the shooting and classes will resume Wednesday. Last year this southwest Florida city of almost 65,000 people had 24 homicides, the most in at least 20 years. Alvis Churchwell, a fifth-grader at the school, said he heard five shots, which scared his classmates. Police responded just before 11 a.m. No students were injured and apparently no children were in the parking lot to witness the shooting, Baker said. The shooter targeted the victim, whom police had not identified Monday night. The suspect remains at large. The police have not released a description or details about the crime. The Apostolic Revival Center and Christian School is a co-ed, private Pentecostal school that teaches children in preschool through fifth grade, according to a state database on private schools. Fort Myers, Fla. Principal Mary Hopson did not return calls for comment. Alvis' grandmother, Mazilene Woody, said she learned what happened through a friend's phone call. All she could think about was last month's mass shooting of elementary school students in Newtown, Conn., where 28 people including 20 children died. After the Connecticut shooting, Woody said she talked with her grandson about how to duck down and stay safe in such a situation. The teachers at the Apostolic Revival Center and Christian School also practiced drills to prepare for such a scenario, Alvis said. Parents were notified of the shooting and many came to pick up their children. No other nearby schools were put on lockdown. Ruthie Ward, who said she is best friends with the homicide victim's sister, said the victim was dropping off his two children at the day care center affiliated with the school when he was killed. Ward pointed out faculty member leading a young girl from the school and identified the girl as the victim's daughter. The girl was wearing a uniform with white, knee-high socks and a colorful backpack. Shirley Chapman, principal of Lee Charter Academy Sam Gene, 42, heard four shots and rushed to the school from his home a few blocks away. His 4-year-old niece attends the school. Once he heard the shots, Gene's first thought was for the child's safety. Gene said he assumes Monday's homicide was motivated by revenge, like so many others in the area. Woody said she considers her grandson safe at the school despite the shooting. The door leading into the school is always locked and visitors have to sign in and out and show identification. Dunbar Community School, a public adult education facility nearby that offers courses including General Educational Development diplomas, English as a second language and computer classes, employs a full-time security guard, Principal Charles Dailey said. But the school never has had a violent incident."}

Two years ago, the teenager killed two brothers in their home and then shot up the La Loche high school. READ MORE: Sombre anniversary marked in La Loche, Sask. The prosecution argued at the hearing that the shooter should be sentenced as an adult after pleading guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and seven counts of attempted murder. A youth sentence carries a maximum term of six years in custody and four years of supervision. As an adult, the shooter faces an automatic life sentence, but would get credit for time already spent in custody, meaning he could be eligible for parole after 10 years.

Dressed in dark clothes and a baseball cap, he had just driven up in a Dodge Ram, jumping out of the pickup as it rolled into the chain-link fence that surrounded the play area. At first, a few of them assumed he had come to help with something or say hello. Then he pulled the trigger. But the shooter kept firing, shattering a glass window. Near the cubbies inside, 6-year-old Collin Edwards felt his foot vibrate, then burn, as if he had stepped in a fire. A bullet had blown through the inside of his right ankle and popped out beneath his big toe, punching a hole in the sole of his Velcro-strapped sneaker. As his teachers pulled him away from the windows, Collin recalled later, he spotted a puddle of blood spreading across the gray wax tile floor in the hallway. Someone else, he realized, had been hurt, too. Above: Jacob Hall was the smallest child in first grade. (Photo by Kerry Burriss) Top: Ava Olsen, holding her cat, Autumn, in her room, alternated between bouts of solitude and anger after the shooting. Outside, Ava had dropped her cupcake. She sprinted toward the far side of the building, rounding a corner to safety. Nowhere in sight, though, was Jacob Hall, the tiny boy with oversize, thick-lensed glasses Ava had decided to marry when they grew up. He had been just a few steps behind her at the door, but she never saw him come out. Ava hoped he was okay. Standing on the wood chips near a yellow tube slide, Siena Kibilko felt stunned. At the initial sound of gunshots, he scrambled over a fence on the opposite side of the playground and briefly headed toward the baseball fields where, as a Townville Giant, he had gotten his first recreation league hit. Karson then turned back to the school and found his classmates banging on a door. The gunfire had stopped by then, and, in a room on the other side of the school, Collin had discovered the source of all that blood. Above: Jacob Hall was the smallest child in first grade. (Photo by Kerry Burriss) Top: Ava Olsen, who thought she would marry Jacob one day, alternated between bouts of solitude and anger after the shooting. Sprawled on the floor was Jacob, the boy Ava adored. But now his eyes were closed, and Collin wondered if they would ever open again. After the shooter was apprehended, a school bus transported shaken students to a nearby church. But the dreamcatcher held special meaning. It had been sent to four other schools ravaged by gun violence, and the names of each were listed on the back: Columbine High in Colorado, Red Lake High in Minnesota, Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, Marysville Pilchuck High in Washington state. A dreamcatcher sent to Townville Elementary has made stops at other schools where students have suffered trauma, including Columbine High and Sandy Hook Elementary. It is slated to travel next to North Park Elementary in San Bernardino, Calif., where in April a man killed his estranged wife, who was a teacher there, and fatally wounded an 8-year-old before taking his own life. Often overlooked, though, are the students who survive the violence but are profoundly changed by it. Beginning with Columbine 18 years ago, more than 135,000 students attending at least 164 primary or secondary schools have experienced a shooting on campus, according to a Washington Post analysis of online archives, state enrollment figures and news stories. A dreamcatcher sent to Townville Elementary has made stops at other schools where students have suffered trauma, including Columbine High and Sandy Hook Elementary. Every child reacts differently to violence at school, therapists have found. Some students, either immediately or later, suffer post-traumatic stress similar to combat veterans returning from war. Many grapple with recurring nightmares, are crippled by everyday noises, struggle to focus in classes and fear that the shooter will come after them again.

Overwhelmingly white, it is home to families that have farmed for decades, retirees with lake houses, college-educated professionals who commute up the road to Clemson University and hundreds of people in mobile homes living from one paycheck to the next. What connects them is a beloved two-story, red-brick school where generations of children have gathered to learn and play and grow up together. And our little boy is downstairs ... The gunman paced the sidewalk, a cellphone in his hand. pistol jammed, ending his rampage 12 seconds after it began. Now Townville Principal Denise Fredericks and some of her staff congregated at the end of a second-floor hallway to keep track of him until help arrived. Then he looked up. He was 14 years old. Not once, Fredericks said, had his behavior prompted concern. He was quiet, earned good grades and almost never got into trouble. He played catcher in the recreation league. He got invited to birthday parties. He was screaming, she said. And Jesse had disappeared. Jesse Osborne shot a teacher and two students near the green metal door at left. Later, students sought shelter in cramped bathrooms. It was his grandson. Thomas pulled up moments after Jesse had been subdued by an armed volunteer firefighter, arriving in time to see his handcuffed grandson loaded into the back of a patrol car. Inside the school, 300 children and teachers cowered in locked classrooms, bathrooms and storage closets. Siena remembered someone covering up windows with paper. Karson remembered playing with markers and magnets. Ava remembered a teacher reading a story about sunflowers. They all remembered the sound of weeping. In the classroom, he saw an alphabet rug soaked with blood. Down the hallway, he found Jacob, whose femoral artery had been sliced by a bullet that struck his left leg. A week later, on a Wednesday morning in October, Jacob lay inside a miniature gray casket topped with yellow chrysanthemums and a Ninja Turtles figurine. He was dressed in a Batman costume. Nineteen days before he was shot, she had written him a note. Now she was at his funeral. Ava wore a Ninja Turtles top with a purple cape. Siena and Collin, who was still in a wheelchair, both dressed as Captain America. Jacob, 6, loved superheroes, and mourners were asked to dress up for the funeral. His mother, Renae Hall, who dressed as Robin, watches her son, who wore a Batman costume, placed into the hearse. Karson had asked, motioning toward a dark pickup. They stared as his body was wheeled up the center aisle at the end of the memorial. The school, scheduled to resume classes the next day, hosted an open house that afternoon. No one knew how the kids would react, but Fredericks, the principal, believed the small step of a brief return might help with the big step of a permanent one. They had to go back. When they did that afternoon, some kids even returned to the playground. Collin rolled out on his light blue medical scooter. Siena climbed a play set. But Ava lingered behind with her mom. Siena, 7, began carrying stuffed animals after the shooting as a form of protection. Loud noises frighten her. Then she never stopped asking. They explained that Jesse was in jail, that she was safe. But still, Siena obsessed over him coming for her again. For Siena, though, each morning included a negotiation with her parents. At drop-off, she would search the parking lot for the cruiser of the police officer assigned to Townville Elementary after the shooting. She needed to know he was there. Like many of her classmates, loud, unexpected sounds petrified her. Once, outside a Publix, a car backfired, and she dropped to the ground before dashing inside. Another time, after a balloon popped at a school dance, the entire gymnasium went silent as the principal rushed to turn the lights on. Fredericks later banned balloons at the spring festival. Siena and her friends began carrying stuffed animals as a form of protection. In those first days back at school, she would slip a tiny pink teddy bear named Lovie into her pocket and squeeze it when she walked onto the playground. Siena again thought of Jesse as her dark eyes fixed on a pink heart taped to the wall. Karson, 7, wonders if he could have done more to protect his friend Jacob, who was half a foot shorter than he was. The big kids were supposed to help the little ones. On their way home, he asked, yet again, if Jacob was getting better. In that moment, she told him his friend had gone to heaven, and Karson began to cry. Collin, now 7, can matter-of-factly discuss what happened on the day of the attack. He says the shooter's gun looked like a plastic, orange-tipped toy pistol in his room. His medical boot had come off months earlier, and the bullet wound had healed, leaving a dark, nickel-size splotch on his ankle. He could run again, too, though sometimes he had to take breaks because of the pain. Then Collin found what he was searching for and held up a plastic pistol with an orange cap on the barrel. Of all the children who survived that day, Collin seemed the most vulnerable to psychological damage in the eyes of many Townville parents and teachers. At school, as long as one of his stuffed animals was within reach, he felt fine. His father, a 200-pound construction worker, broke down about what had happened more often than Collin did. But Collin, now 7, can discuss that day with clarity and composure. Perhaps no one understands that better than Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose son survived the Sandy Hook massacre but whose daughter did not. Ava gets a kiss as her dad arrives home from work. Months after the shooting, Ava still did not feel safe at school. Ava sat on the edge of a brown exam table, her eyes on the floor. It was mid-February, five months after the shooting, and her pediatrician kept asking questions. Three weeks later, the doctor filled out a state form recommending that she be home-schooled. She started hitting herself and yanking out her eyelashes, and once clawed her nails so deep into her elbow that it became infected. Ava had mastered a cartwheel days before the shooting but no longer talked about becoming a cheerleader. Ava ducks to avoid seeing Townville Elementary as her brother, Cameron, is dropped off at school. She's now home-schooled, and she uses stickers to cover words in her books that she finds disturbing. The shooting had lasted just 12 seconds. They sent Ava to two therapists, took her to doctors who gave her medication for anxiety, encouraged her to record her thoughts in a leopard-print journal. Suddenly, Cameron frightened her. She pushed him and he fell backward, hitting his head against a stone well. Blood trickled down the back of his neck. Their parents loaded the kids into the car and rushed to the emergency room. Jesse Osborne, now 14, sometimes had heated arguments with his father, seen in an undated photo. His mother, Tiffney, in a photo taken weeks before the shooting, says the violent day came as a shock. (Family photos) Forty miles away, the 14-year-old at the center of it all sat inside a juvenile detention center on a recent evening and considered his future. He wants to fly there one day. His mother, Tiffney Osborne, remembers the wild rabbit he once rescued from the jaws of a family guard dog. Jesse kept it alive for five days in a cardboard box. Many of the 4,000 people who call Townville home say they've always felt safe in their one-stoplight community of farmers, retirees and college professionals. The teen had handled guns since he was young, but so had many other kids in Townville. But maybe he fired the gun for some other reason. Father and son, Tiffney said, sometimes had heated arguments. Jesse also told the firefighter that he was sorry. In seventh grade, his family said, he was kicked out of school after bullies harassed him and he snapped. A fellow student, Patsy said, had spotted something frightening in his backpack: a hatchet. The school playground, the scene of sudden violence last September, continues to be used by students today. Some kids headed to the swings and others to the play sets. Collin, wearing a black T-shirt with a green smiley face, talked to a friend at a picnic table near where the truck had careened into the chain-link fence, since replaced by a shiny new section. He held his stuffed turtle, Tortle. A game of tag broke out, and Karson chased a friend, just as he used to when he played the Joker and Jacob played Batman. Siena, gripping a stuffed purple cheetah named Glamour, wandered past a pink metal ladder with a hole, likely the result of rust, that she believed had come from a bullet. As recess neared its end, a half-dozen of the kids carefully placed their stuffed animals atop a green metal bench. Siena leaned down and pointed at Glamour.

READ MORE: Court releases 46-page transcript of Townville shooting suspect's confession The next witnesses to take the stand were Greenville County Juvenile Detention Center employees Lt. Barbara Pressley and Ofc. Trista Price. Pressley testified that although much of the suspect's behavior at the detention center was average in comparison with fellow inmates, he had been involved in several incidents while detained. According to detention center records released during the hearing, a report was made on Dec. 2, 2016 when the suspect made a joke about the crimes for which he is accused. He is charged with murder after officials say he opened fire on the school playground, killing 6-year-old student Jacob Hall. Juv is asking to go to the Townville parade as a special guest. Juv stated that this time he will not bring a gun but fireworks. Juv is making these and other comments about his crime loud enough that others in the dorm can hear him. Juv was asked to go lay down and stop yelling out loud. The suspect's defense attorney asked if these loud remarks could be an attempt to intimidate other detainees out of fear, however Pressley said she didn't believe that was the reason behind the comments. Dr. Danielle Atkinson, a psychologist who also testified Wednesday, saying he did not show visible signs of remorse after the shooting and failed to understand the seriousness of his actions. Atkinson said factors like low empathy for others, antisocial behavior, lack of remorse and a pattern of severe behavior indicate the suspect may be difficult to rehabilitate. Pressley testified that the teen was assaulted in a classroom by other males in the detention center as part of a gang initiation. The suspect was a bystander in the incident and has displayed no indication he is involved in any gang activity. According to the detention center records, the suspect was also warned for using homophobic slurs against another inmate in January 2016. Records indicate he refused breakfast and medication numerous times, which Pressley said is not abnormal for minors in the detention center. Price testified about once returning from a break to an incident between the teen suspect and a guard. He was given 48 hours in his cell for the threat, Pressley said. Both Pressley and Price testified that the suspect had not been placed on suicide watch or made an attempt to harm himself. Overall both officers said he was cooperative and interacts with other inmates. The officials aren't aware of the suspect bullying anyone and said he has been rewarded for receiving good grades. Christel Harris, a teacher at the detention center who is employed by Greenville County Schools, said the suspect is on the honor roll and has had good behavior in the classroom. He is currently in a wheelchair due to an injury while playing basketball at the facility.

Brock and other first responders were heroes in the way they helped the injured and secured the scene Wednesday at Townville Elementary School so no one else was hurt, fire Chief Billy McAdams said. Brock was apparently unarmed and information wasn't immediately available on whether the 14-year-old gunman, whose name has not been released because he is being charged as a minor pending a Friday court hearing, was readying to shoot again. The students and teacher were hit as they opened a door to go out to the playground for recess. Teacher Meghan Hollingsworth, shot in the shoulder, and the second kindergartner, shot in the foot, were treated at a hospital Wednesday and released. School officials told him over the phone that the shooter was in the rear of the building and children had been hit near the playground. The men rushed to the school and found a black pickup, empty, that had crashed through the playground fence. Then they decided to split up, McAdams going inside the school and Brock casing the outside, the fire chief said. What they didn't know at the time: Jeffrey Osborne, 47, the father of the teen shooter, was dead in his Townville home. He realized that Jacob was the most severely injured and provided cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and other medical care to him as other responders began to arrive. Meanwhile, Brock was corralling the gunman outside, keeping him on the ground until authorities arrived to take him into custody, McAdams said. Both Brock, in his statement, and McAdams called for prayer for Jacob, who remains in intensive care in Greenville Memorial Hospital. Heroism was all around the school Wednesday afternoon, McAdams said. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

The Boulder County Sheriff's Office is behind the proposal and said the move would make Niwot High School and Lyons Middle Senior High School safer for students and teachers. School shootings have become a new reality. The sheriff's office is concerned both schools are at least 10 to 15 minutes from the nearest police department or sheriff's office. Law enforcement is concerned about what could happen if a shooter opened fire inside either school, with just one armed school resource officer on campus, armed with only a handgun. School resource officers are equipped with assault rifles, but those weapons are kept in the deputy's vehicle. Under the proposal, those weapons would be stored in a safe inside the school where a resource officer would have easier access to it. The guns would be stored in a safe that could only be accessed with a deputy's fingerprint. Donna Bitterman teaches at another school in the area, but her stepson attends Niwot High School. She said she understands why law enforcement is concerned, but is worried about the unintended consequences of having AR-15s inside the school. The school board would have to approve the proposal before the rifles would be allowed inside the schools next fall. Another community meeting will be held for parents at 6 p.m. Thursday at Sunset Middle School in Longmont so that parents can ask questions and share their opinions. Email us.

The school district announced a series of security enhancements it was working on afterwards. She said she has four children in the school district, including two at NWMS, one of who was across the hall during the shooting. Now she's a member of the group Noblesville Stands Together, working to make sure what happened at Noblesville doesn't happen again. State and local leaders are also focused on improving safety. Earlier this week, Governor Holcomb announced a program providing metal detector wands to schools at no cost, one per every 250 students. Recommendations from the governor's school safety task force are also due in August. In an email to parents, Noblesville Superintendent Beth Niedermeyer updated parents on the district's safety enhancements. The email also outlined the police department's plans to triple the number of school resource officers. Police say while SRO's are hired and trained, they will devote officers to cover schools and extra-curricular activities as needed. The district said other measures include more surveillance equipment, new visitor and student procedures, more online monitoring tools and more safety training. The district also plans to look into enhanced facility structures and more mental health support. He, like some other parents, said the safety update is a step in the right direction. No ideas are being implemented that will prevent it from happening again. Wands are a great idea, but unless you scan everybody everyday there is still a risk of someone bringing a gun to school. Another group formed advocating for safety, S.O.S. Noblesville, also weighed in on metal detector wands. Last month the district provided members of the public opportunities to weigh in during its school board meeting, and plans to offer the public safety forum again on July 18 at Noblesville High School.

The messages also reveal the suspect planned the attack days before the shooting. Messages were also sent that said the suspect had decided not to shoot up his middle school because a school resource officer worked there and it was too far away. Below are excerpts of messages sent by the suspect which were released in court: Sep. Internet searches were also discovered for mass shooters Omar Mateen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.

Potentially armed teachers, for example, would do that very, very well. Yet if we do nothing, it seems our children are still pretty safe, as NPR notes. And that makes sense. It makes school shootings more difficult. As a result, parents started locking up their guns. While they knew their son or daughter was a good kid, they worried some friend might grab a pistol.

A 6-year-old boy wounded during a shooting at a South Carolina elementary school this week has died, his mother said Saturday. Jacob Hall was hit in a femoral artery and a massive blood loss led to a major brain injury. He died Saturday, Renae Hall wrote on Facebook. A family statement added thanks to doctors and the community. The 14-year-old boy suspected of the shooting at Townville Elementary School was charged Friday with three counts of attempted murder. He was also charged with murder in connection with the killing of his father at the family home. CNN is not naming the accused shooter because he is a minor. His case is being heard in family court, and it is not yet clear whether he will be tried as an adult. Jacob was one of three people shot when the teen opened fire on the school playground Wednesday. Another student and a teacher were treated and released on the day of the shooting. Authorities said they believe the teen shot his father, then took a pickup to the school in the small community of Townville, where he began firing as he got out of the vehicle.
